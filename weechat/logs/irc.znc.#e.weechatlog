2016-09-04 12:32:21	the_waiter	[14:20:54] its still changing pid. I am not able to kill it
2016-09-04 12:32:21	the_waiter	[14:22:14] I will reinstall Bodhi in the near future. Forget it
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[14:30:37] okay, you can try to shutdown e and everything which uses efl
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[14:30:40] go to a tty
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[14:30:51] kill it, and try to launch it again and see what is happening
2016-09-04 12:32:21	archfae	[14:32:11] Looking forward to it.

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[22:33:19] Hello
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:35:40] Morning
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:36:24] can someone please tell me how to keep E from dimming the backlight when it logs out?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	Simotek	[03:39:44] raster likes it that way, theoretically the display manager is ment to bring it back in
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:45:36] Well, for some reason it dimm on boot as well.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:45:41] dims
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:46:08] right defore lightdm, sddm, or whatever dislays
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:46:32] before
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:47:03] ctrl+backspace doesn't do this only logout or shutdown.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:47:39] It also only hapens with E, loging out of xfce or lxqt, etc. is fine as well.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:47:55] I'm not sure what it is changing to cause this.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:48:13] X11 or what?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	OhYash	[03:55:15] dims on boot?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	OhYash	[03:55:25] before loading E?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:58:25] Yes, before loading the DM. I'n not sure why but only e dims what ever it is that is causing this.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[03:59:01] Loging out or rebooting from any othe DE / WM doesn't cause this.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:00:08] also ctrl+backspace leaves the backlight alone as well.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	rafspiny	[04:02:07] HI all, is econnman the reccomended network tool for e?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:09:25] Yes, unless you want to rebuild network manager applet with indicator suport
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:09:48] or use a third party system tray
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:10:36] aka stalonetray
2016-09-04 12:32:21	efraim	[04:18:13] Is the econnman release still good or should I make a case for packaging from git-head?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:25:23] Simotek: any idea what is causingthis?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	rafspiny	[04:31:05] jamesk: thanks. I remember there was a plan to replace econnman a couple a months ago. I was asking the same question because i ran in a lot of problems trying to use it for a VPN
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:31:56] really, connman
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:32:09] connman supports vpn
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:33:39] just not in a nice gui like NM
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:34:55] https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Connman#Settings
2016-09-04 12:32:21	rafspiny	[04:54:01] jamesk: at the time I needed to connet to a VPN with a particular configuration. I am afraid I do not remember now. It was at my previous workplace
2016-09-04 12:32:21	jamesk	[04:59:04] ;)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:24:15] rafspiny: Well openvpn works here.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:50:27] Man
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:51:35] I can't get express to work. :(
2016-09-04 12:32:21	rafspiny	[05:53:33] AJSlye: I never tried to compile it. Is express the IRC client?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:54:30] Yes, I was using it prior to rinatall
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:54:42] but now I get a segfault
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:54:57] Used the same pkgbuild file
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:55:12] only changed the dep from elementary to efl
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:56:02] EFL and Enlightenment installed the same way just on Manjaro xfce ather than Manjaro gnome.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:57:13] But I did compile the previous express on EFL 1.17.2 and this time on EFL 1.18, but that shouldn't cause a segfault
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[05:57:39] AJSlye: can you run "gdb express"
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[05:57:41] then "r"
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[05:57:51] then it should crash and tell you something about SIGSEGV
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[05:57:59] then "bt" and paste the output somewhere?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:58:11] =one sec, beed to re-install gdb
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[05:58:41] sorry about the typos, can't read the input box in hexchat
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[05:59:09] np :) no hurry

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:02:21] <bu5hm4n>: there you go.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:04:29] AJSlye: okay, you need to add -g to your CFALGS otherwise we cannot see where it exactly crashes ...
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:05:01] ok rebuilding expreessnow
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:05:58] I have export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fvisibility=hidden" in my packagebuilld, could this be causing the issue or just add -g
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:06:07] pkgbuild
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:06:59] noep, i dont think this is causing it
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:07:00] and yes
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:07:06] -g to the that :)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:09:24] hmm, I did build efl from the efl-1.18 branch in git, Just a fyi
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:09:39] I wanted a good set of docs
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:10:06] Okay, that shouldnt do a that big difference, since express is using stable api
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:10:14] the barball was lacking some files to build the docs properlu
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:10:19] tarball
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:10:49] ouh... does Simtek know about it ?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:12:04] Not sure raster fixed it in master and the branch
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:12:14] rrrr
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:12:27] built it with -g and same output
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:12:59] waaaa? have you installed it again ?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:13:14] Yes

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:32:52] could be the way it was built or efl for that matter

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:41:52] debugin is a PIA in Arch

2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:43:37] AJSlye: i am just checking code snippets
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[06:43:44] will push a fix soon :)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[06:44:31] I like the terminology brings up images you click on
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[06:44:35] when they're links
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[06:44:40] such as on irc
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[06:44:55] but...if you have a small terminal window - they only fill the small window
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[06:45:16] is there a way to make it so that they fill the whole screen, or go to a native resolution if it's bigger than the terminal window?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:48:06] hmm
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:48:27] <bu5hm4n> cool beens

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:53:53] what irc client are you using in terminology?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[06:54:12] irssi

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:59:39] The preview window
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[06:59:53] resizes acourdingly with the main window
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:00:49] full screen: http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-57cbfecca18c50.91003207.jpg
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[07:01:13] yeah
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[07:01:22] I think it would be better if it didn't
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:01:27] small window: http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-57cbfefb946714.26581700.jpg
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:01:47] callipygous: so spawn a seperate window and display it in there?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[07:01:55] well, shouldn't it do it
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:02:07] callipygous: if you have teamwork enabled you hsould have something like that while mouse hover on it
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[07:03:03] ah, I'm not in e
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:03:04] AJSlye: okay i can fix this bug in efl, but then express is just a transparent window :(
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[07:03:13] I'm using Terminology , though
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:03:15] döp döp döööööp :P
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[07:03:22] bo-derp
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:03:46] well, that doesn't sound good.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:04:01] AJSlye: noep, we probebly have to wait on der_Metzger
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:04:09] Yep
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:04:10] devilhorns: ...
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:04:13] That's ok
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:04:47] But Hexchat is not going to cut it if I can;'t read the input box
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:05:03] Off to find something better.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:05:17] I do like polari
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:05:36] but it depends on networkmanager.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:06:07] wad ?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	callipygous	[07:06:40] irssi!

2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:07:12] AJSlye: are you 100% that the theme is installed ?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:07:31] Oh I know it's the theme
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:07:35] but still
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:07:37] LOL

2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:08:21] so that the theme of express got installed ...
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:08:32] I build all my packages using a clean chroot
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:08:40] yes
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:08:55] I build a package
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:09:01] not install local
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:09:08] then install the package
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:09:22] much cleaner builds that way
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:09:37] crete chroot
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:09:52] nuild and install efl in chroot
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:10:07] then build express and package
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:10:11] in chroot
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:10:24] never been an issue
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:10:25] can you give the PKGBUILD for express?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:10:37] yea, I'll post it to my github
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:10:45] ok
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:12:34] https://github.com/NuLogicSystems/express/blob/master/PKGBUILD
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:13:19] AJSlye: thank you :)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:13:24] ;)

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:32:01] you think that didn't get installed?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:32:13] joup :)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:32:18] I'll need to look inside the package then.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:33:30] nope: /usr/share/express/themes/default.edj
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:33:43] that's installed
2016-09-04 12:32:21	bu5hm4n	[07:33:58] damn

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:36:08] ahh, hat's a shot in the dark though
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:37:49] here is the file list of the package: http://pastebin.com/AKtXmLFJ
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:39:19] OK, I got pamac-notifier in the systemtray now.

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:40:29] Had to go and manually delet the .desktop file that came in pamac as they  have the same name string in them.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:41:01] so startup applications only saw one
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[07:41:37] Upate notifier

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[08:11:57] <bu5hm4n>: thanks I'll look at it again after church.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[08:12:32] PS. This is why I like the E developers.

2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[08:13:30] I can't spell today. LOL
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[08:14:33] E devs are #1 in the help and supporteria

2016-09-04 12:32:21	swiftgeek	[08:22:22] is 1.18.4 enough or something newer is needed?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	swiftgeek	[08:29:06] i see some bug report https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95337
2016-09-04 12:32:21	swiftgeek	[08:29:25] but i don't see where patch/commit that was actually applied
2016-09-04 12:32:21	swiftgeek	[08:31:20] oh i see in patchwork that it was accepted
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[08:41:30] 1.18.4?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	AJSlye	[09:18:23] OK, time for breakfast..
2016-09-04 12:32:21	swiftgeek	[09:41:34] huh
2016-09-04 12:32:21	swiftgeek	[09:42:05] smooth backlight adjustment doesn't work smoothly anymore on master
2016-09-04 12:32:21	swiftgeek	[09:42:33] it works when hitting key/combination for it once
2016-09-04 12:32:21	swiftgeek	[09:42:37] but not when holding

2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[22:33:19] Hello
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:35:40] Morning
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:36:24] can someone please tell me how to keep E from dimming the backlight when it logs out?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Simotek	[03:39:44] raster likes it that way, theoretically the display manager is ment to bring it back in
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:45:36] Well, for some reason it dimm on boot as well.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:45:41] dims
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:46:08] right defore lightdm, sddm, or whatever dislays
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:46:32] before
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:47:03] ctrl+backspace doesn't do this only logout or shutdown.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:47:39] It also only hapens with E, loging out of xfce or lxqt, etc. is fine as well.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:47:55] I'm not sure what it is changing to cause this.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:48:13] X11 or what?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	OhYash	[03:55:15] dims on boot?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	OhYash	[03:55:25] before loading E?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:58:25] Yes, before loading the DM. I'n not sure why but only e dims what ever it is that is causing this.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[03:59:01] Loging out or rebooting from any othe DE / WM doesn't cause this.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:00:08] also ctrl+backspace leaves the backlight alone as well.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	rafspiny	[04:02:07] HI all, is econnman the reccomended network tool for e?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:09:25] Yes, unless you want to rebuild network manager applet with indicator suport
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:09:48] or use a third party system tray
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:10:36] aka stalonetray
2016-09-05 21:58:39	efraim	[04:18:13] Is the econnman release still good or should I make a case for packaging from git-head?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:25:23] Simotek: any idea what is causingthis?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	rafspiny	[04:31:05] jamesk: thanks. I remember there was a plan to replace econnman a couple a months ago. I was asking the same question because i ran in a lot of problems trying to use it for a VPN
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:31:56] really, connman
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:32:09] connman supports vpn
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:33:39] just not in a nice gui like NM
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:34:55] https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Connman#Settings
2016-09-05 21:58:39	rafspiny	[04:54:01] jamesk: at the time I needed to connet to a VPN with a particular configuration. I am afraid I do not remember now. It was at my previous workplace
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jamesk	[04:59:04] ;)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:24:15] rafspiny: Well openvpn works here.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:50:27] Man
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:51:35] I can't get express to work. :(
2016-09-05 21:58:39	rafspiny	[05:53:33] AJSlye: I never tried to compile it. Is express the IRC client?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:54:30] Yes, I was using it prior to rinatall
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:54:42] but now I get a segfault
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:54:57] Used the same pkgbuild file
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:55:12] only changed the dep from elementary to efl
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:56:02] EFL and Enlightenment installed the same way just on Manjaro xfce ather than Manjaro gnome.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:57:13] But I did compile the previous express on EFL 1.17.2 and this time on EFL 1.18, but that shouldn't cause a segfault
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[05:57:39] AJSlye: can you run "gdb express"
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[05:57:41] then "r"
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[05:57:51] then it should crash and tell you something about SIGSEGV
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[05:57:59] then "bt" and paste the output somewhere?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:58:11] =one sec, beed to re-install gdb
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[05:58:41] sorry about the typos, can't read the input box in hexchat
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[05:59:09] np :) no hurry

2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:02:21] <bu5hm4n>: there you go.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:04:29] AJSlye: okay, you need to add -g to your CFALGS otherwise we cannot see where it exactly crashes ...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:05:01] ok rebuilding expreessnow
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:05:58] I have export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fvisibility=hidden" in my packagebuilld, could this be causing the issue or just add -g
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:06:07] pkgbuild
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:06:59] noep, i dont think this is causing it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:07:00] and yes
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:07:06] -g to the that :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:09:24] hmm, I did build efl from the efl-1.18 branch in git, Just a fyi
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:09:39] I wanted a good set of docs
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:10:06] Okay, that shouldnt do a that big difference, since express is using stable api
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:10:14] the barball was lacking some files to build the docs properlu
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:10:19] tarball
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:10:49] ouh... does Simtek know about it ?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:12:04] Not sure raster fixed it in master and the branch
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:12:14] rrrr

2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:24:29] okay, but thats strange, at least we should see "main"
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:24:54] Don't know
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:25:09] crashes imidiately
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:25:29] waaait, express build per default with -g ... WAAAAD
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:30:55] AJSlye: good thing it also crashes for me
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:31:03] ;)

2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:32:00] what's strange is if I build it against elementary 1.and force install it, it runs fine,
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:32:16] 1.17
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:32:33] yea
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:32:52] could be the way it was built or efl for that matter
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:33:31] my efl pkgbuild is here: https://github.com/NuLogicSystems/efl/blob/master/PKGBUILD
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:41:36] <bu5hm4n>: You know what, Arch
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:41:52] debugin is a PIA in Arch
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:43:25] AJSlye: i am running in arch :P works well :P
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:43:37] AJSlye: i am just checking code snippets
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[06:43:44] will push a fix soon :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[06:44:31] I like the terminology brings up images you click on
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[06:44:35] when they're links
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[06:44:40] such as on irc
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[06:44:55] but...if you have a small terminal window - they only fill the small window
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[06:45:16] is there a way to make it so that they fill the whole screen, or go to a native resolution if it's bigger than the terminal window?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:48:06] hmm
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:48:27] <bu5hm4n> cool beens

2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:59:39] The preview window
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[06:59:53] resizes acourdingly with the main window
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:00:49] full screen: http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-57cbfecca18c50.91003207.jpg

2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[07:01:47] callipygous: so spawn a seperate window and display it in there?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[07:01:55] well, shouldn't it do it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[07:02:07] callipygous: if you have teamwork enabled you hsould have something like that while mouse hover on it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[07:03:03] ah, I'm not in e
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[07:03:04] AJSlye: okay i can fix this bug in efl, but then express is just a transparent window :(
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[07:03:13] I'm using Terminology , though
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[07:03:15] döp döp döööööp :P
2016-09-05 21:58:39	callipygous	[07:03:22] bo-derp
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:03:46] well, that doesn't sound good.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[07:04:01] AJSlye: noep, we probebly have to wait on der_Metzger
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:04:09] Yep
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[07:04:10] devilhorns: ...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:04:13] That's ok
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:04:47] But Hexchat is not going to cut it if I can;'t read the input box
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:05:03] Off to find something better.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:05:17] I do like polari
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:05:36] but it depends on networkmanager.

2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[07:08:21] so that the theme of express got installed ...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:08:32] I build all my packages using a clean chroot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:08:40] yes
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:08:55] I build a package
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:09:01] not install local
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:09:08] then install the package
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:09:22] much cleaner builds that way
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:09:37] crete chroot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:09:52] nuild and install efl in chroot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:10:07] then build express and package
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:10:11] in chroot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:10:24] never been an issue

2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:39:19] OK, I got pamac-notifier in the systemtray now.

2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:40:29] Had to go and manually delet the .desktop file that came in pamac as they  have the same name string in them.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[07:41:01] so startup applications only saw one

2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[09:42:05] smooth backlight adjustment doesn't work smoothly anymore on master
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[09:42:33] it works when hitting key/combination for it once
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[09:42:37] but not when holding
2016-09-05 21:58:39	wfx	[12:36:38] hi, enlightenment (rel 0.21.2) in src/modules/appmenu/src_modules_appmenu_module_la-e_mod_main.lo i get a cc1: error: unknown pass systemd/bin" specified in -fenable

2016-09-05 21:58:39	@raster	[20:35:30] nyan
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Simotek	[21:12:47] gah my adventure into wayland has broken my backlight control

2016-09-05 21:58:39	jls_legalize	[06:05:46] Hi
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jls_legalize	[06:06:20] on "everything" if I want to open a file with another program, I cannot

2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB	[12:31:20] ManMower: derek your timing patches will also solve the performace issues (ie pointers) or its completely unrelated?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Vonor|Work	[12:50:29] hi. I just installed enlightenment as a replacement for kde. So far so nice, but i got two issues with virtualbox.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Vonor|Work	[12:52:30] 1: the vm stays black (win10 guest) and if i move the mouse to the vbox menu (fullscreen mode) i get a flicker of the vm window. I can hear that windows has booted up due to the nasty sound win10 plays after boot. but i see nothing
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Vonor|Work	[12:52:43] 2: fullscreen in virtualbox doesn't cover the enlightenment dock
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:01:45] Anyone know how to fix the backlight diming on startup and logout.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:02:08] This only hapens when loging out from E.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:02:38] if I logout or restart from any other DE the backlight is not dimmed
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:02:43] dimed
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB	[13:03:16] AJSlye: disable it all together]
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:03:20] but if I log out restart from e the backlight dims right before the DM loads
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:03:33] even on reboot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:04:19] disable what exactly, I still need the display to dim as my system runs 24/7
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:04:50] or do mean only on logout?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB	[13:05:41] not sure if it will work but try Settings > Look >Compositor > Dont fade backlit
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:06:28] Does that effect when the system is idle as well?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:06:45] aka backlight settings
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB	[13:07:37] not sure
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:08:10] OK, ticked that setting. will try a logout now and see.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:08:14] brb
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:16:04] OK, I;m back
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:16:16] ApBBB: that worked
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:16:22] so far
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:16:53] Also, express started loading again. And I did nothing.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:17:42] I was supposed to chery pick a coomit from master when compiling EFL to fix it but havent had a chance yet.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:17:48] Vonor|Work: Click on the tob bar icon (top left) and Window > Maximize > Fullscreen
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:18:24] AJSlye: did it work?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:18:30] It just started working again. I'm not sure what that's about.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:18:40] Yes, That worked.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:18:47] ok
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Vonor|Work	[13:20:10] ApBBB_, what? the vm is already in fullscreen mode.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:20:12] just waiting to see if it still dims after sitting idle. but atleast I won't need to squint anymore to login after logout or restart.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:20:32] or I mean reboot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:20:38] not restart.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:21:22] Vonor|Work: maximize (sits on top of the shelf) and fullscreen (takes up all the screen) are different in E AFAI understand
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Vonor|Work	[13:23:40] ApBBB_, I'm talking about virtualbox's fullscreen mode (HOST-F). The VM starts in that mode. I have a 2 screen setup. on screen 2 it covers the entire screen (obviously, no dock), on screen1 the fullscreen goes only to the dock.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:23:59] <bu5hm4n> you still here?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[13:24:07] ok i has not much knowledge of efl
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[13:24:09] but...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[13:24:20] would it be possible to port it a bit to libpayload?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:24:27] Vonor|Work:  not sure then. Sorry
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[13:24:34] AJSlye: joup
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[13:24:40] AJSlye: well partly :D
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:25:06] get this, Express just loaded this morning when a accidently clicked it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[13:25:20] \o/
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:25:22] I never got a change to patch my EFL package
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[13:25:23] so the fix worked?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Vonor|Work	[13:25:25] ApBBB_, the main problem is, however, that I have a black screen in the vm. i switched back to kde meanwhile and the vm works like a charm.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[13:25:28] hahaha
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[13:25:30] wad
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[13:25:41] anyway, the crash *i* got, is fixed :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:25:51] All I've done to my system so far is change the icon theme
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:26:12] and Install polkit-efl
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:26:35] epad, and rebuild python-efl
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:26:48] Vonor|Work: i tested with a windows XP VM that i have and it worked fine. So i can't help with that
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[13:27:24] AJSlye: mhmm anyway as long as its fixed :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:28:41] oh and epack, python-elm-extensions, and python-pypdf2
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:28:53] strange huh
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:28:55] LOL
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:29:27] OH well, atleast a bug was found and fixed anyway.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:29:33] ;)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:31:05] Express does need some love, but I still like it better than the alternatives...;)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:32:40] express is the IRC thing devilhorns wrote right?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:33:30] Just have to make this comment, rage 0.2.1 now loads everything I've thrown at it.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:33:56] ApBBB_: Yes, IRC client bassed on terminology.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:34:14] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-57cdac8e040194.63037284.jpg
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:34:18] ok.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:34:56] rage didn't until i built efl with xine support
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:35:05] interesting
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:35:33] not sure if that helped or not. LOL
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:35:34] what wasn't working?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:35:48] gstreamer plays anything thats why i am asking
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:36:36] didn't used to load or display properly most of my mpegs, after I rebuilt it from the release tarball they not play and.or display properly
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:36:56] rr now not not
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:37:10] they now work properly
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:38:23] Maybe something is different with my gstreamer then. I don't know
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:38:33] It just works better now.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:39:28] the one thing I don't like is that on Arch we have to have all of VLC and not just the codecs.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:39:43] But that a distro issue.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:40:16] Maybe I'll create a libvlc package of my own and upload it to the AUR or something,
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:40:55] But not today, Have to go pick my son back up from hus mother today,
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:40:56] IMO only gstreamer should be enabled
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:41:09] maybe file a bug in arch to discuss it with the dev
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:42:18] Well, unfortunately terminology still uses emotion_generic_players so still need to build it into EFL
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[13:42:25] hey
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:43:00] the issue is packaging of vlc in arch is all or nthing, where other distro's seperate the gui and libs/codects
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:43:31] So suport can be built without the gui
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:43:53] where are emotion generic players are used in terminology
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:43:55] ?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	CompanionCube	[13:44:17] I'd imagine for the pop-up dialog things
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:44:55] I'm not sure exactly, Terminology has always needed it to build.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:45:10] or recomended at least
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:46:30] In arch it shows as  (optional) - video support
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:46:48] emotion_generic_players (virtual) (optional) - video support
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:47:20] elm apps can use multiple backends (gst1 vlc etc)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:47:32] Yes, I know.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:47:47] so unless it is used for something gst can't handle its not needed
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:48:06] Is there anything else that uses these as I think maybe they should be dropped if nothing else uses them.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:48:10] but better ask biliob
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:48:47] But like I said not an issue on other distros just arch
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:49:29] and a vlc packaging issue, nothing more.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:51:46] distros (arch in particular) follow what upstream recomends. vlc is recomented in E but to my understanding its not needed now that gst works fine.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:52:24] if E said use gst i doubt ARch would put it as a dep
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:52:36] So, thearetically it would be possible to either not build EFL with it, or as an optional depend
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:52:45] the way Arch packages vlc is another matter alltogethte
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[13:52:51] alltogether
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:52:57] Yes, I know
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:53:43] that was what I was saying, would be nive not to need the gui with it. I can think of a few other apps besides E that supports vlc as a backend.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:53:50] nice
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:56:18] Phonon comes to mind
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:56:45] can use it as a backend but doen't nesseraly need the gui with it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:57:51] Would there be any advers effects of building EFL with vlc as a build and optional dependancy but nit a hard dependancy?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:58:00] not
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:58:23] I wonder
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:58:26] hmm
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:58:34] a test is in order I think.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[13:59:57] Anyway not a major issue
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:00:14] Just nice that rage loads and plays all my videos now
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:01:45] I don't use arches upstream E packages anyway, they are always behind
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:01:59] so I have room to play..
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[14:04:11] latest is in testing. NO idea when the packager will move it to stable. Its kind of a stupid situations :/
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:05:28] not exactly, These came out of testing today.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:06:41] However enlightenment is still behind 0.21.1 to be exact. and they are still built with patches that are either not needed or backported.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:07:06] and the efl docs are not complete, missing screen shots
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:07:14] for elementary
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:07:18] etc.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[14:10:37] This is why I'm maintaining my own PKGBUILDS.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[14:12:46] just saw it came out.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[14:13:05] however it fucked up with terminology
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:38:13] Is it possible to run efl without linux kernel and glibc ?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:38:27] Let's say with a really low footprint libc library
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:42:28] https://github.com/xmikos/cryptboot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:42:35] ah sorry wrong channel
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[15:42:49] zaolin_: its the kind of question that unless the knowledgeable people are around you won't get an answer in IRC. better sent a mail to the dev mailing lisgt
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:43:48] ApBBB_: Okay good to know
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[15:44:56] zaolin_: wait 12h
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[15:45:03] and ask question again :P
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jayji_	[15:50:11] zaolin_: I would say you need at least a posix layer
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:51:00] jayji_: So efl on embedded isn't really true. I saw a lot glibc functions in the ecore code.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jayji_	[15:51:10] zaolin_: and then cut efl down, because it relies on a loot of stuff.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jayji_	[15:51:38] zaolin_: on what type of chip do you want to use efl? if it is a microcontroller, it will be very difficult
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:52:39] coreboot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:52:51] x86, arm, power8, risc-v ;)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jayji_	[15:53:01] zaolin_: ecore can compile without glibc, it compiles fine on osx which another libc (apple libc)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jayji_	[15:53:25] zaolin_:  oh nice :-)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:54:17] jayji_; So I need to adapt it to the coreboot payload libc and write an framebuffer module for the coreboot fb.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jayji_	[15:55:55] zaolin_: for the graphics, it will be a bit tricky I guess... we have a fbcon module, but that is linux only... maybe it can be adapted?? I am not really sure, but it may save a lot of work.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jayji_	[15:56:32] and yes, you would need something like Evil (a little posix layer on windows)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[15:56:58] jayji_: Thanks for the help. We will start porting it and seeing how far we get.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	jayji_	[15:58:04] zaolin_: it will be also a good idea to post in the mailing list, you will have more inputs :-) I hope to see EFL in coreboot :-)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[16:00:22] that would be amazing :>
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[16:01:10] jayji_: as for coreboot fb, after coreboot does all the init efl would only need to write to some area in memory
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[16:01:19] in some bit setting
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[16:01:33] like 888 etc ;P
2016-09-05 21:58:39	zaolin_	[16:03:02] jayji_; Hopefully we can integrate it. There are no so much alternatives ;)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[16:06:10] efl ftw :D
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[16:06:24] would love to make new nvramcui with it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	swiftgeek	[16:06:40] with integrated stuff like from coreinfo and everything
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:27:01] ApBBB_: You just saw what come out, E on Arch? What is f'ed up with terminology?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:27:24] terminologu is working fine here using my PGBUILD
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[16:27:57] there is a new one in testing that has to be releassed also
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[16:28:00] he forgot it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:28:11] A new what?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:29:04] Oh iI see it Terminology.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:30:30] The only diference in hois PKGBUILD is the dependancy on Elementary to EFL.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:30:52] otherwise same it the same.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:31:16] https://bugs.archlinux.org/index.php?do=details&action=details.addvote&task_id=50666
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:31:21] if you are interessted in the ticket
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:32:16] ApBBB_: this does not really solve the problem
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:32:39] every single project which ever was used with the package Elementary is now broken
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:32:58] so every single pkgbuild scimma or fillfeile have done ...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[16:34:01] the aur stuff are the -respective- maintainers stuff. the official repo one is ronalds job for which he fucked up a bit
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:34:32] yes but the elementary dep woud be virtual anyway with the replaces aray in efl. Or am I wrong?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:34:49] AJSlye: yes that would solve the problems
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[16:35:17] E is not that popular so not a huge deal.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[16:35:27] just a matter of updating the PKGBUILDS
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:35:50] ApBBB_: sure, its the problem of the aur maintainers, but why breaking theire work ? if you could just go a "parallel" way
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:36:08] also, if the elementary package would not be removed, you could simply install elementary and efl in parallel
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[16:36:10] its a one liner fix
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:36:23] without anything complaining
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:36:36] because efl does not replace nor provide elementary...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:38:46] bu5hm4n: Actually efl uses the replace aray in the pkgbuild but not provides as that is not needed if elementary is removed from repository.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:39:14] otherwise replaces would be the wrong thing to use and conflicts provides would be needed
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:40:40] oh it uses the replace, true
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:40:47] But not in parrellel as the file locations would be the same and pacman would error and abort.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:41:19] you would need to change the file locations to install these in parallel
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:41:28] noep, version is different
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:41:40] if at least the theme yes, and the data
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:41:46] but not the library itself ...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:42:05] pacman would still complainfile already exists
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:42:18] and abort the install
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:43:17] not that sure, are there directoryies which are not version depending?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:43:23] efl 1.18 and elementary 1.17 cant be install in parallel for that reason
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:43:36] yes
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:45:14] okay, then it would fail on that, but anyway, i dont think its a good path to go and break the aur´s people packages ...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:45:42] All of EFL and elementary, etc. are instelled without version numbers
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:46:17] like /udr/bin /usr/lib etc.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:46:35] aaah the apps true
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:46:41] the libraries should not fail on that
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:47:07] since its libelementary.so.1.18.99
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:47:58] actually /usr/lib/ecore_evas/engines/drm/v-1.18/module.so
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:48:05] etc.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:48:12] for the engines yes,
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:48:21] but they where always part of efl
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:49:50] that was just an example as would /usr/lib/efreet/v-1.18/efreet_icon_cache_create
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:50:16] so yes the libs are version installed.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:50:27] v-1.18
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:50:56] but not the rest and this is why parallel would not work
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:51:20] like /usr/include/evas-1/canvas/efl_canvas_proxy.eo.h
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:51:30] no versioning
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:51:48] anyway.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[16:52:50] bu5hm4n: how much work is to add the normal e icons to verne instead of the FDO stuff?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:54:53] ApBBB_: using e icons, much work
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:55:12] using elm icons just set the icons in the apps
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[16:56:21] don't like the elm ones. don't look enlightenish enough :/
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[16:59:14] ApBBB_: hum ... maybe elm needs to update... they indeed look a bit smoother
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[16:59:22] Which icon set is the one with the outhouse looking icon for home?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ApBBB_	[17:00:52] its not a matter of smooth or not. its an aesthetic thing
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[17:03:58] Nevermind I figured it out. LOL
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[17:04:12] I like the smooth blue ones.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	bu5hm4n	[17:06:18] ApBBB_: with smooth i mean something like "cooler" :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[17:06:53] The elm / enlightenment-x needs more icons though. ;)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[17:07:46] or maybe it's just some naming issues.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[17:08:51] but for now 've set vertex-mia everywhere.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[17:10:18] even if it is green
2016-09-05 21:58:39	AJSlye	[17:10:21] LOL

2016-09-05 21:58:39	@raster	[21:13:51] what did i get wrong when shuffling the data structs/arrangement around?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@raster	[21:23:53] ooh i think i have gotten it right finally!
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Stuzz	[21:28:07] 'bout time

2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[07:02:07] callipygous: if you have teamwork enabled you hsould have something like that while mouse hover on it
2016-09-06 11:21:04	callipygous	[07:03:03] ah, I'm not in e
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[07:03:04] AJSlye: okay i can fix this bug in efl, but then express is just a transparent window :(
2016-09-06 11:21:04	callipygous	[07:03:13] I'm using Terminology , though

2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:05:17] I do like polari
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:05:36] but it depends on networkmanager.

2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[07:08:21] so that the theme of express got installed ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:08:32] I build all my packages using a clean chroot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:08:40] yes
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:08:55] I build a package
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:09:01] not install local
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:09:08] then install the package
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:09:22] much cleaner builds that way
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:09:37] crete chroot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:09:52] nuild and install efl in chroot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:10:07] then build express and package
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:10:11] in chroot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[07:10:24] never been an issue

2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[00:13:28] Simotek: are you booting with acpi_backlight=none ?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jls_legalize	[06:05:46] Hi
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jls_legalize	[06:06:20] on "everything" if I want to open a file with another program, I cannot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[06:26:35] jls_legalize: file it on phab. the'll see it there
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[06:26:42] they
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jls_legalize	[06:26:59] ok ApBBB
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[12:31:20] ManMower: derek your timing patches will also solve the performace issues (ie pointers) or its completely unrelated?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Vonor|Work	[12:50:29] hi. I just installed enlightenment as a replacement for kde. So far so nice, but i got two issues with virtualbox.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Vonor|Work	[12:52:30] 1: the vm stays black (win10 guest) and if i move the mouse to the vbox menu (fullscreen mode) i get a flicker of the vm window. I can hear that windows has booted up due to the nasty sound win10 plays after boot. but i see nothing
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Vonor|Work	[12:52:43] 2: fullscreen in virtualbox doesn't cover the enlightenment dock
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:01:45] Anyone know how to fix the backlight diming on startup and logout.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:02:08] This only hapens when loging out from E.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:02:38] if I logout or restart from any other DE the backlight is not dimmed
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:02:43] dimed
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[13:03:16] AJSlye: disable it all together]
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:03:20] but if I log out restart from e the backlight dims right before the DM loads
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:03:33] even on reboot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:04:19] disable what exactly, I still need the display to dim as my system runs 24/7
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:04:50] or do mean only on logout?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[13:05:41] not sure if it will work but try Settings > Look >Compositor > Dont fade backlit
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:06:28] Does that effect when the system is idle as well?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:06:45] aka backlight settings
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[13:07:37] not sure
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:08:10] OK, ticked that setting. will try a logout now and see.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:08:14] brb
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:16:04] OK, I;m back
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:16:16] ApBBB: that worked
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:16:22] so far
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:16:53] Also, express started loading again. And I did nothing.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:17:42] I was supposed to chery pick a coomit from master when compiling EFL to fix it but havent had a chance yet.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:17:48] Vonor|Work: Click on the tob bar icon (top left) and Window > Maximize > Fullscreen
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:18:24] AJSlye: did it work?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:18:30] It just started working again. I'm not sure what that's about.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:18:40] Yes, That worked.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:18:47] ok
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Vonor|Work	[13:20:10] ApBBB_, what? the vm is already in fullscreen mode.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:20:12] just waiting to see if it still dims after sitting idle. but atleast I won't need to squint anymore to login after logout or restart.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:20:32] or I mean reboot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:20:38] not restart.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:21:22] Vonor|Work: maximize (sits on top of the shelf) and fullscreen (takes up all the screen) are different in E AFAI understand
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Vonor|Work	[13:23:40] ApBBB_, I'm talking about virtualbox's fullscreen mode (HOST-F). The VM starts in that mode. I have a 2 screen setup. on screen 2 it covers the entire screen (obviously, no dock), on screen1 the fullscreen goes only to the dock.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:23:59] <bu5hm4n> you still here?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[13:24:07] ok i has not much knowledge of efl
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[13:24:09] but...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[13:24:20] would it be possible to port it a bit to libpayload?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:24:27] Vonor|Work:  not sure then. Sorry
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[13:24:34] AJSlye: joup
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[13:24:40] AJSlye: well partly :D
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:25:06] get this, Express just loaded this morning when a accidently clicked it
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[13:25:20] \o/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:25:22] I never got a change to patch my EFL package
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[13:25:23] so the fix worked?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Vonor|Work	[13:25:25] ApBBB_, the main problem is, however, that I have a black screen in the vm. i switched back to kde meanwhile and the vm works like a charm.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[13:25:28] hahaha
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[13:25:30] wad
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[13:25:41] anyway, the crash *i* got, is fixed :)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:25:51] All I've done to my system so far is change the icon theme
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:26:12] and Install polkit-efl
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:26:35] epad, and rebuild python-efl
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:26:48] Vonor|Work: i tested with a windows XP VM that i have and it worked fine. So i can't help with that
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[13:27:24] AJSlye: mhmm anyway as long as its fixed :)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:28:41] oh and epack, python-elm-extensions, and python-pypdf2
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:28:53] strange huh
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:28:55] LOL
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:29:27] OH well, atleast a bug was found and fixed anyway.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:29:33] ;)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:31:05] Express does need some love, but I still like it better than the alternatives...;)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:32:40] express is the IRC thing devilhorns wrote right?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:33:30] Just have to make this comment, rage 0.2.1 now loads everything I've thrown at it.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:33:56] ApBBB_: Yes, IRC client bassed on terminology.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:34:14] http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-57cdac8e040194.63037284.jpg
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:34:18] ok.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:34:56] rage didn't until i built efl with xine support
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:35:05] interesting
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:35:33] not sure if that helped or not. LOL
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:35:34] what wasn't working?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:35:48] gstreamer plays anything thats why i am asking
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:36:36] didn't used to load or display properly most of my mpegs, after I rebuilt it from the release tarball they not play and.or display properly
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:36:56] rr now not not
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:37:10] they now work properly
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:38:23] Maybe something is different with my gstreamer then. I don't know
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:38:33] It just works better now.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:39:28] the one thing I don't like is that on Arch we have to have all of VLC and not just the codecs.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:39:43] But that a distro issue.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:40:16] Maybe I'll create a libvlc package of my own and upload it to the AUR or something,
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:40:55] But not today, Have to go pick my son back up from hus mother today,
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:40:56] IMO only gstreamer should be enabled
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:41:09] maybe file a bug in arch to discuss it with the dev
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:42:18] Well, unfortunately terminology still uses emotion_generic_players so still need to build it into EFL
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[13:42:25] hey
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:43:00] the issue is packaging of vlc in arch is all or nthing, where other distro's seperate the gui and libs/codects
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:43:31] So suport can be built without the gui
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:43:53] where are emotion generic players are used in terminology
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:43:55] ?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	CompanionCube	[13:44:17] I'd imagine for the pop-up dialog things
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:44:55] I'm not sure exactly, Terminology has always needed it to build.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:45:10] or recomended at least
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:46:30] In arch it shows as  (optional) - video support
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:46:48] emotion_generic_players (virtual) (optional) - video support
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:47:20] elm apps can use multiple backends (gst1 vlc etc)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:47:32] Yes, I know.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:47:47] so unless it is used for something gst can't handle its not needed
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:48:06] Is there anything else that uses these as I think maybe they should be dropped if nothing else uses them.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:48:10] but better ask biliob
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:48:47] But like I said not an issue on other distros just arch
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:49:29] and a vlc packaging issue, nothing more.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:51:46] distros (arch in particular) follow what upstream recomends. vlc is recomented in E but to my understanding its not needed now that gst works fine.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:52:24] if E said use gst i doubt ARch would put it as a dep
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:52:36] So, thearetically it would be possible to either not build EFL with it, or as an optional depend
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:52:45] the way Arch packages vlc is another matter alltogethte
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[13:52:51] alltogether
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:52:57] Yes, I know
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:53:43] that was what I was saying, would be nive not to need the gui with it. I can think of a few other apps besides E that supports vlc as a backend.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:53:50] nice
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:56:18] Phonon comes to mind
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:56:45] can use it as a backend but doen't nesseraly need the gui with it
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:57:51] Would there be any advers effects of building EFL with vlc as a build and optional dependancy but nit a hard dependancy?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:58:00] not
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:58:23] I wonder
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:58:26] hmm
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:58:34] a test is in order I think.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[13:59:57] Anyway not a major issue
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:00:14] Just nice that rage loads and plays all my videos now
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:01:45] I don't use arches upstream E packages anyway, they are always behind
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:01:59] so I have room to play..
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[14:04:11] latest is in testing. NO idea when the packager will move it to stable. Its kind of a stupid situations :/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:05:28] not exactly, These came out of testing today.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:06:41] However enlightenment is still behind 0.21.1 to be exact. and they are still built with patches that are either not needed or backported.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:07:06] and the efl docs are not complete, missing screen shots
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:07:14] for elementary
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:07:18] etc.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[14:10:37] This is why I'm maintaining my own PKGBUILDS.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[14:12:46] just saw it came out.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[14:13:05] however it fucked up with terminology
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:38:13] Is it possible to run efl without linux kernel and glibc ?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:38:27] Let's say with a really low footprint libc library
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:42:28] https://github.com/xmikos/cryptboot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:42:35] ah sorry wrong channel
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[15:42:49] zaolin_: its the kind of question that unless the knowledgeable people are around you won't get an answer in IRC. better sent a mail to the dev mailing lisgt
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:43:48] ApBBB_: Okay good to know
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[15:44:56] zaolin_: wait 12h
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[15:45:03] and ask question again :P
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jayji_	[15:50:11] zaolin_: I would say you need at least a posix layer
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:51:00] jayji_: So efl on embedded isn't really true. I saw a lot glibc functions in the ecore code.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jayji_	[15:51:10] zaolin_: and then cut efl down, because it relies on a loot of stuff.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jayji_	[15:51:38] zaolin_: on what type of chip do you want to use efl? if it is a microcontroller, it will be very difficult
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:52:39] coreboot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:52:51] x86, arm, power8, risc-v ;)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jayji_	[15:53:01] zaolin_: ecore can compile without glibc, it compiles fine on osx which another libc (apple libc)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jayji_	[15:53:25] zaolin_:  oh nice :-)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:54:17] jayji_; So I need to adapt it to the coreboot payload libc and write an framebuffer module for the coreboot fb.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jayji_	[15:55:55] zaolin_: for the graphics, it will be a bit tricky I guess... we have a fbcon module, but that is linux only... maybe it can be adapted?? I am not really sure, but it may save a lot of work.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jayji_	[15:56:32] and yes, you would need something like Evil (a little posix layer on windows)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[15:56:58] jayji_: Thanks for the help. We will start porting it and seeing how far we get.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jayji_	[15:58:04] zaolin_: it will be also a good idea to post in the mailing list, you will have more inputs :-) I hope to see EFL in coreboot :-)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[16:00:22] that would be amazing :>
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[16:01:10] jayji_: as for coreboot fb, after coreboot does all the init efl would only need to write to some area in memory
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[16:01:19] in some bit setting
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[16:01:33] like 888 etc ;P
2016-09-06 11:21:04	zaolin_	[16:03:02] jayji_; Hopefully we can integrate it. There are no so much alternatives ;)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[16:06:10] efl ftw :D
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[16:06:24] would love to make new nvramcui with it
2016-09-06 11:21:04	swiftgeek	[16:06:40] with integrated stuff like from coreinfo and everything
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:27:01] ApBBB_: You just saw what come out, E on Arch? What is f'ed up with terminology?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:27:24] terminologu is working fine here using my PGBUILD
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[16:27:57] there is a new one in testing that has to be releassed also
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[16:28:00] he forgot it
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:28:11] A new what?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:29:04] Oh iI see it Terminology.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:30:30] The only diference in hois PKGBUILD is the dependancy on Elementary to EFL.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:30:52] otherwise same it the same.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:31:16] https://bugs.archlinux.org/index.php?do=details&action=details.addvote&task_id=50666
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:31:21] if you are interessted in the ticket
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:32:16] ApBBB_: this does not really solve the problem
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:32:39] every single project which ever was used with the package Elementary is now broken
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:32:58] so every single pkgbuild scimma or fillfeile have done ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[16:34:01] the aur stuff are the -respective- maintainers stuff. the official repo one is ronalds job for which he fucked up a bit
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:34:32] yes but the elementary dep woud be virtual anyway with the replaces aray in efl. Or am I wrong?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:34:49] AJSlye: yes that would solve the problems
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[16:35:17] E is not that popular so not a huge deal.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[16:35:27] just a matter of updating the PKGBUILDS
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:35:50] ApBBB_: sure, its the problem of the aur maintainers, but why breaking theire work ? if you could just go a "parallel" way
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:36:08] also, if the elementary package would not be removed, you could simply install elementary and efl in parallel
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[16:36:10] its a one liner fix
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:36:23] without anything complaining
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:36:36] because efl does not replace nor provide elementary...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:38:46] bu5hm4n: Actually efl uses the replace aray in the pkgbuild but not provides as that is not needed if elementary is removed from repository.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:39:14] otherwise replaces would be the wrong thing to use and conflicts provides would be needed
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:40:40] oh it uses the replace, true
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:40:47] But not in parrellel as the file locations would be the same and pacman would error and abort.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:41:19] you would need to change the file locations to install these in parallel
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:41:28] noep, version is different
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:41:40] if at least the theme yes, and the data
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:41:46] but not the library itself ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:42:05] pacman would still complainfile already exists
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:42:18] and abort the install
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:43:17] not that sure, are there directoryies which are not version depending?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:43:23] efl 1.18 and elementary 1.17 cant be install in parallel for that reason
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:43:36] yes
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:45:14] okay, then it would fail on that, but anyway, i dont think its a good path to go and break the aur´s people packages ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:45:42] All of EFL and elementary, etc. are instelled without version numbers
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:46:17] like /udr/bin /usr/lib etc.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:46:35] aaah the apps true
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:46:41] the libraries should not fail on that
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:47:07] since its libelementary.so.1.18.99
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:47:58] actually /usr/lib/ecore_evas/engines/drm/v-1.18/module.so
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:48:05] etc.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:48:12] for the engines yes,
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:48:21] but they where always part of efl
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:49:50] that was just an example as would /usr/lib/efreet/v-1.18/efreet_icon_cache_create
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:50:16] so yes the libs are version installed.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:50:27] v-1.18
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:50:56] but not the rest and this is why parallel would not work
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:51:20] like /usr/include/evas-1/canvas/efl_canvas_proxy.eo.h
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:51:30] no versioning
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:51:48] anyway.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[16:52:50] bu5hm4n: how much work is to add the normal e icons to verne instead of the FDO stuff?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:54:53] ApBBB_: using e icons, much work
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:55:12] using elm icons just set the icons in the apps
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[16:56:21] don't like the elm ones. don't look enlightenish enough :/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[16:59:14] ApBBB_: hum ... maybe elm needs to update... they indeed look a bit smoother
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[16:59:22] Which icon set is the one with the outhouse looking icon for home?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB_	[17:00:52] its not a matter of smooth or not. its an aesthetic thing
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[17:03:58] Nevermind I figured it out. LOL
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[17:04:12] I like the smooth blue ones.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[17:06:18] ApBBB_: with smooth i mean something like "cooler" :)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[17:06:53] The elm / enlightenment-x needs more icons though. ;)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[17:07:46] or maybe it's just some naming issues.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[17:08:51] but for now 've set vertex-mia everywhere.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[17:10:18] even if it is green
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[17:10:21] LOL
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[20:41:31] nyan
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[20:57:41] Hi
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[21:00:05] hyo
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[21:12:27] How you doin'
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[21:12:39] italian accent needed. LOL
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[21:13:32] grrrr
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[21:13:39] why doesn't this work?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[21:13:51] what did i get wrong when shuffling the data structs/arrangement around?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[21:23:53] ooh i think i have gotten it right finally!
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Stuzz	[21:28:07] 'bout time
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[21:35:23] well this is stage one...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[21:54:13] Yea, I know I am. LOL
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:52:39] testing wayland on the main system and its a funky experience :/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:53:30] Video HW acceleration (gst) and previews crash. \o/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:53:53] evas image loader gst also burns to the ground
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:54:39] Xwayland doesn't work (fixed in git where has a different bug but this will be fixed in 0.21.3 i believe)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:54:51] window remembers dont work
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[03:55:40] window remembers will sadly never work ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:55:59] is it a protocol thing?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[03:56:51] no but i think hte compositor is not aware of any name or something like that ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:57:13] the HW acceleration related crash is nasty. With VDPAU it restarts E with VAAPI it freezes the whole thing
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[03:58:25] bu5hm4n: there is some stuff in xdg
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[03:58:30] xdg_shell
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:58:31] its kind of stupid to have to rearange the apps that i have to start in the begining every time i restart E
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:58:41] in each workspace
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[03:58:44] it can work. apps just have to provide enough metadata
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[03:59:30] changing Virtual desktops also seemed to consume a bit of CPU in WL. Is it normal?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[03:59:32] raster: oh okay, (i never really looked at xdg_shell) ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[03:59:49] there is at least a desktop file name
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[03:59:54] i thought there was something else
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:01:16] oh there's also uuid we use for session recovery on scrash and restart
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:01:27] will of course work only for efl apps
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:01:39] but is uuid the same between reboots?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:02:37] raster: is there something that affects thumbnailing when HW acceleration is present in gst? On my main system videos don't thumbnail :/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:03:05] thats up to the app
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:03:09] if it stores it - yes
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:03:29] ApBBB:  gst generic loader?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:03:56] maybe i don't know
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:04:15] it has nothing to do with wl
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:04:22] happens in X also
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:04:26] its purely displayless back-end
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:04:50] in terminology when i used tyls it generated a thumbnail
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:04:55] in efm it doesnt
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:05:06] terminology uses ethumb
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:05:08] on X
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:05:16] e uses its own
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:05:18] as does rage
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:06:04] don't have rage on this system.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:06:22] aaaah there is the title property, and there is the set_app_id where i can find a desktop file for :)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:06:34] yeah
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:06:35] also on wayland playing video in terminology didn't work
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:06:37] tho title is for display
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:06:40] not identification
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:06:43] but you can use that
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:07:01] i suspect HW acceleration with gst in WL is severly broken
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:07:02] but app id yeah
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:07:09] tho that wont work well for an app with multiple windows
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:07:19] there is some wildcard mechanism in window remembers,
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:07:23] we need another string that is the window "identifier"
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:07:27] so you can identify on app_id AND title
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:07:31] you only need one
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:07:52] as long as its unique for identification reasons for that app
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:07:54] but if i have sublime and a dialog of sublime, both appid´s will be the same ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:08:49] yeah
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:08:52] thus the above
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:09:04] like if you can have
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:09:15] yeah but if we also use the title (which hopefully will be different for the dialog)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:09:26] then we can make sure to have them seperated
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:09:31] "myapp.main",  "myapp.fileopen", "myapp.areyousure"
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:09:32] etc.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:09:43] the problem is titles often change
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:09:52] eg they are empty or generic then change based on status
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:10:58] meh sucks ... there should be something like the uuid for all wl apps
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:11:45] i know
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:12:51] btw. its now fact. all aur apps keep beeing broken :(
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:13:29] ?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:13:37] all aur apps?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:13:40] like arch ones?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:13:57] elementary got completly removed, so maintainers have to update theire builds ... and there are many ...
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:13:59] yep
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:14:23] well yeah it gets removed
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:14:33] the efl aur build should add a "provides"
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:14:40] for elm
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:14:55] yep
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:16:08] someone just needs to flag them. no big deal
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:18:29] when you maintain a package you have to "maintain it" obviously
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:21:09] what does it matter, of course you have to maintain it, but its again the question if you are just going to break shit for all people, or not
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:21:24] its one line for on person, or one line for many people
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:22:27] life is short. break things :P
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[04:26:35] well this would be an explicit break if the efl aur pkg didnt also provide the simple backwards compatibility of adding a "provides" like that makes it provide an old pkg that it now replaces
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:30:18] i have zero expectations from the maintainer :/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:30:22] so yeah
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:49:21] does phab has any problems sending emails today?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[04:51:15] ApBBB: not just today, something looks b0rked, feed is also not working
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[04:51:54] ok
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[05:14:35] APTX:  fixed
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[05:14:38] r
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[05:14:47] oh apbbb left
2016-09-06 11:21:04	APTX	[05:24:05] I'm not even sure why I'm here, I'm not using whatever you're doing here
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[05:40:14] hahahaha
2016-09-06 11:21:04	raster	[05:40:15] :)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[05:42:55] enlightenment wayland running on enlightenment wayland used to work :/ now it doesn't
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[10:33:01] I'm havong an issue with epour from git.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[10:33:30] the torrent adds and downloads but doesn't show up in the main window
2016-09-06 11:21:04	AJSlye	[10:39:01] I guess I need to catch kuuko later on this one.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:45:32] ManMower: ping?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:48:57] ApBBB: hai
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:49:21] ApBBB: don't bother testing my timing branch yet, it'll cause you nothing but trouble. :)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:50:34] ok. but i have some questions. Does this patchset also affect performance (the pointer stuff we were seeing)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:51:04] also do you have HW acceleration working with gstreamer on any of your wayland machines
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:51:43] video HW accel that is
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:51:46] oh
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:51:56] I hadn't thought about "your" cursor problem in a while.  yes, it should make that go away
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:52:32] because you won't fall back to unsynchronized ticking anymore, and won't get a bunch of full redraws for cursor moves
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:53:15] re: HW accel on gstreamer, no.  I've got a co-worker who works primarily on gstreamer and I've been helping him ramp up on wayland
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:53:53] he's going to start looking into wayland-sink problems shortly
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:54:11] i started testing on the main machine and i get crashes and freezes
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:54:20] with gst and hw acceleration
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:54:27] yikes, on an intel gpu?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:54:35] radeon
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:54:38] r600
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:54:45] wow that's old
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:54:51] 6850
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:54:59] hrm, maybe not as old as I thought
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:55:04] is it AGP ;)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:55:11] no pci-e
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:55:15] 4years old
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:55:21] by crashes and freezes you mean whole system or just the gst pipeline?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:55:23] ok not new but not ancient
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:55:30] the whole thing
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:55:35] sigh
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:55:43] I doubt any of our work will help you there :(
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:56:06] we don't have radeon hardware to test on
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:56:12] is the problem only under wayland?  it works great on x?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:56:14] buy some :P
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:56:28] vdpau works on X not on wayland
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:56:55] vaapi doesn't work anywhere
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:57:20] we're looking at some changes in vaapi, but not around the hardware stuff, just wayland proto stuff
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:58:16] do you know what is supposed to work with what in WL regarding accelerated video?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:58:26] everything is "supposed" to work ;)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:58:45] who on earth tests those stuff :P
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:58:55] anyway
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:59:14] I have some kind of radeon in the basemeent
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:59:24] if it's agp I can't do much useful testing though
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:59:33] buy the latest one. seems cool
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:59:36] :P
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[10:59:39] I'm an nvidiot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[10:59:41] rx480
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[10:59:56] your are a nvidiot? how can you do wayland stuff?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[11:00:00] bu5hm4n: intel gpus :)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[11:00:13] dafuq
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[11:00:51] i don't think i'll touch another intel product if i have the choise. :/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[11:00:58] O.o
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[11:01:15] he will stay on his good old 32 bit amd stuff
2016-09-06 11:21:04	bu5hm4n	[11:01:18] forever :P
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[11:01:50] i'll go AMD all the way if i build another PC
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[11:02:53] anyway. noticed some other things also on the main machine. stuff like moving windows seem to consume more CPU than doint the same in weston. I know e does more than weston but is this normal behavior?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ApBBB	[11:18:55] ManMower: derek one more question. does bulding efl with egl instead of full-gl has any impact on X? and if no is there any reason it is not the recomented way to build it?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[11:19:42] I'm not sure.  suspect it doesn't work at all with X
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ManMower	[11:20:23] moving a window should be about the same between E and weston (except E might update the deskmirror)...

2016-09-06 11:21:27	ManMower	on the main machine - I assume hardware gl?
2016-09-06 11:22:48	ManMower	there were some problems with buffer aging a couple of months ago but should all be fixed now.  I don't know any obvious reason why there should be a large difference.  I'll keep a look out though, may be a subtle regression again. :/
2016-09-06 11:26:34	@devilhorns	I'd suspect that moving the window around is causing a full redraw of the main compositor canvas (the E ecore_evas)
2016-09-06 11:26:54	ManMower	yeah, if it was his other computer I'd be sure that's what it was
2016-09-06 11:27:04	ManMower	surprised to see it on the main machine
2016-09-06 11:27:09	@devilhorns	ohhh, he's not running a dinasour anymore ?
2016-09-06 11:27:21	ManMower	I think it's still oldish, but not the netbook?
2016-09-06 11:30:24	ApBBB	intel i7 3770 12GB ram radeon 6850
2016-09-06 11:30:41	ApBBB	quite a capable machine i think.
2016-09-06 11:31:18	ApBBB	ok the radeon needs to be replaced i think with an rx480 but  thats not a burning issue

2016-09-06 11:34:13	ApBBB	oh another issue on the main machine is that Xwayland doesn't work. Needs a patch to be pulled from git and a bug to be fixed (T4439). Probably those will go in by 0.21.3
2016-09-06 11:34:35	ManMower	so sick of xwayland crashes
2016-09-06 11:34:36	ApBBB	devilhorns: :) normal is good
2016-09-06 11:36:01	ApBBB	on git Xwayland seem to be have ok. at least some crashes i was seeing some time ago are not there anymore. (minus the preview problem)
2016-09-06 11:40:26	bu5hm4n	devilhorns: moved to a new place?
2016-09-06 11:41:35	@devilhorns	bu5hm4n, no, don
2016-09-06 11:41:41	@devilhorns	I don't move until October

2016-09-06 11:43:51	@devilhorns	bu5hm4n, yes
2016-09-06 11:44:03	bu5hm4n	i meant "to which place will you move"
2016-09-06 11:44:19	@devilhorns	bu5hm4n, ohhh lol. moving about 6 miles away from where I am now

2016-09-06 12:00:37	_ami_	captainigloo: i like experimental stuffs. ;)
2016-09-06 12:00:50	captainigloo	_ami_: it should work with two fb
2016-09-06 12:00:52	_ami_	captainigloo: did you log your work somewhere? blog? github?
2016-09-06 12:01:14	_ami_	captainigloo: used fbtft drivers for spi TFTs?
2016-09-06 12:01:21	captainigloo	_ami_: there is a phab wiki
2016-09-06 12:01:30	captainigloo	_ami_: but not only for that
2016-09-06 12:01:47	captainigloo	_ami_: i tried fbtft but never with e
2016-09-06 12:02:18	captainigloo	it should work, you will be limited by the SPI bandwith, but it should work for a basic display
2016-09-06 12:03:13	_ami_	captainigloo: yah, spi hw speeds on rpi is close to 64 MHz
2016-09-06 12:03:32	_ami_	bit-banging is very slow..  i think its in KHz.
2016-09-06 12:03:52	captainigloo	_ami_: https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/boot2efl/

2016-09-06 12:05:24	captainigloo	but it's not exactly what you asked
2016-09-06 12:05:46	_ami_	atleast i  got some pointers so i can start
2016-09-06 12:06:15	captainigloo	after that i manage to work on porting the engine we did for boot2efl for rpi
2016-09-06 12:06:30	captainigloo	iirc cedric merged it on master branch
2016-09-06 12:06:33	captainigloo	before 1.18
2016-09-06 12:06:42	captainigloo	so it should be already there
2016-09-06 12:07:32	_ami_	oh yah.. i remember this patch.
2016-09-06 12:07:38	_ami_	cool

2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[11:54:06] captainigloo: hi.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[11:55:34] captainigloo: i heard from zmike that you tried running e on rpi2. is it possible to run single instance of e on two fb (fb0 and fb1) devices?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[11:59:29] _ami_: hi
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[11:59:49] hum what i did was 'experimental'
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:00:15] _ami_: e was not at least running on one fb, but not really pretty well
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:00:37] captainigloo: i like experimental stuffs. ;)
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:00:50] _ami_: it should work with two fb
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:00:52] captainigloo: did you log your work somewhere? blog? github?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:01:14] captainigloo: used fbtft drivers for spi TFTs?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:01:21] _ami_: there is a phab wiki
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:01:30] _ami_: but not only for that
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:01:47] _ami_: i tried fbtft but never with e
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:02:18] it should work, you will be limited by the SPI bandwith, but it should work for a basic display
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:03:13] captainigloo: yah, spi hw speeds on rpi is close to 64 MHz
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:03:32] bit-banging is very slow..  i think its in KHz.

2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:05:18] _ami_: my work was derived on that
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:05:24] but it's not exactly what you asked
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:05:46] atleast i  got some pointers so i can start
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:06:15] after that i manage to work on porting the engine we did for boot2efl for rpi
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:06:30] iirc cedric merged it on master branch
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:06:33] before 1.18
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:06:42] so it should be already there
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:07:32] oh yah.. i remember this patch.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:07:38] cool

2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:08:34] _ami_: expedite was running at least
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:08:56] not sure i get more than expdite
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:09:01] i can't remember
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:09:18] ah yes elementary_test was launching correctly also
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:09:25] but there was problem with inputs
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:10:11] i did all my tests with a rpi1
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:10:39] captainigloo: do you have the setup guide?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:11:39] hum no
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:11:55] i did my build with yocto
2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:12:46] and added --enable-eglfs to configure

2016-09-06 13:56:54	captainigloo	[12:13:33] you need to enable ecore-fb also
2016-09-06 13:56:54	_ami_	[12:14:00] ok
2016-09-06 13:56:54	cedric	[13:05:29] captainigloo, yes, the input part is not merged as it was waiting on devilhorns elput library work at the time

2016-09-06 14:59:25	ManMower	also it'll be implemented as wp_viewporter, I don't know if we'll ever impl wl_scaler
2016-09-06 14:59:32	ManMower	gst will be updated to use wp_viewporter instead
2016-09-06 14:59:39	ManMower	I assume you're testing git gst
2016-09-06 14:59:47	ManMower	because that's where I ran into trouble with it not existing
2016-09-06 14:59:47	ApBBB	ok gst-play wasn't working and gave me a message related to that
2016-09-06 14:59:56	ApBBB	gst from the repos
2016-09-06 15:00:05	ApBBB	arch
2016-09-06 15:00:08	ManMower	yeah, recent gst tries to use wl_scaler even if it doesn't need it.
2016-09-06 15:00:10	ManMower	some bullshit.
2016-09-06 15:00:12	ApBBB	1.8.3
2016-09-06 15:01:05	ApBBB	ok. There is a bigger problem with video though. Using vaapi (fuck wrong instruction in wikis :( ) i get choppy video on both wayland and X
2016-09-06 15:02:01	ManMower	maybe someone else can help, but if it's choppy on X it's outside of my area of effect

2016-09-06 15:02:38	ApBBB	could also be a HW issue. :/
2016-09-06 15:02:45	ManMower	indeed
2016-09-06 15:02:46	ApBBB	no idea how to find out about this
2016-09-06 15:02:55	ManMower	gst probably has a support #
2016-09-06 15:03:08	ManMower	the gst guys I know are really great
2016-09-06 15:03:29	ApBBB	i'll give it a try tomorrow
2016-09-06 15:04:23	ApBBB	BTW some of the peformance issues i am seeing in Wayland are from terminology pointer blinking. you were working on that right?
2016-09-06 15:04:56	ManMower	yeah.  for normal systems that's not a problem anymore. ;)
2016-09-06 15:05:03	ManMower	what I'm working on now might resolve it for you too
2016-09-06 15:05:28	ApBBB	is it fixed in git? because i am on 1.18 on the main system
2016-09-06 15:05:41	ManMower	oh.  should be.
2016-09-06 15:06:04	ManMower	I think it was fixed on 1.18
2016-09-06 15:06:42	ApBBB	hmmm. i see it on the main system. At least there was cpu load when had terminology focused
2016-09-06 15:07:38	ApBBB	there are other "smoothness" issues. probably the canvas redraws dh mentioned. those are for 1.19 if i remember correctly.
2016-09-06 15:08:09	ManMower	just dragging around a window is choppy?
2016-09-06 15:08:20	ManMower	how much cpu usage are you seeing?
2016-09-06 15:08:51	ApBBB	no not choppy. i just see increased cpu.
2016-09-06 15:09:12	ManMower	how much cpu?
2016-09-06 15:10:33	ApBBB	i'll check again and tell you tomorrow. need to observe it a bit more. HOwever what i remember is that it was a bit more than moving a window around in weston
2016-09-06 15:10:56	ApBBB	if there is a way to precicely measure things like that let me know
2016-09-06 15:11:02	ManMower	hehe nope
2016-09-06 15:11:18	ManMower	maybe it's just evas being heavier than weston's toy scenegraph :/
2016-09-06 15:11:41	ApBBB	could be. what i noticed to load the cpu was changing between virtual desktops
2016-09-06 15:11:52	ManMower	I'm in software render mode right now,  nothing happening but terminology's blinking cursor.  4% cpu all spent in _evas_rendeR_phase1_object_process
2016-09-06 15:12:21	ApBBB	how you measure that?
2016-09-06 15:12:27	ManMower	perf
2016-09-06 15:12:30	ManMower	sudo perf top
2016-09-06 15:12:38	ManMower	(logged in via ssh so it's not causing any draws in the E session)
2016-09-06 15:13:05	ApBBB	arrg i need a second machine that works properly.
2016-09-06 15:13:50	ApBBB	the 32bit machine is not suitable for sshing into stuff. (keyboard somehow broken making typing things a nightmare)
2016-09-06 15:14:15	ApBBB	or at least i need a second keyboard :P
2016-09-06 15:14:25	ManMower	hehe
2016-09-06 15:16:38	ApBBB	there was another perf command you mentioned some time ago that was working per app. what was that again?
2016-09-06 15:17:09	ManMower	perf record
2016-09-06 15:17:28	ApBBB	thanks
2016-09-06 15:17:55	ManMower	np
2016-09-06 15:18:18	ManMower	that makes a file called perf.data  you can view the reesults with perf report

2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[14:59:01] ApBBB: that's on my todo list now :/
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[14:59:25] also it'll be implemented as wp_viewporter, I don't know if we'll ever impl wl_scaler
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[14:59:32] gst will be updated to use wp_viewporter instead
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[14:59:39] I assume you're testing git gst
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[14:59:47] because that's where I ran into trouble with it not existing
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[14:59:47] ok gst-play wasn't working and gave me a message related to that
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[14:59:56] gst from the repos
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:00:05] arch
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:00:08] yeah, recent gst tries to use wl_scaler even if it doesn't need it.
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:00:10] some bullshit.
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:00:12] 1.8.3
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:01:05] ok. There is a bigger problem with video though. Using vaapi (fuck wrong instruction in wikis :( ) i get choppy video on both wayland and X
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:02:01] maybe someone else can help, but if it's choppy on X it's outside of my area of effect
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:02:38] could also be a HW issue. :/
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:02:45] indeed
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:02:46] no idea how to find out about this
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:02:55] gst probably has a support #
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:03:08] the gst guys I know are really great
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:03:29] i'll give it a try tomorrow
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:04:23] BTW some of the peformance issues i am seeing in Wayland are from terminology pointer blinking. you were working on that right?
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:04:56] yeah.  for normal systems that's not a problem anymore. ;)
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:05:03] what I'm working on now might resolve it for you too
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:05:28] is it fixed in git? because i am on 1.18 on the main system
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:05:41] oh.  should be.
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:06:04] I think it was fixed on 1.18
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:06:42] hmmm. i see it on the main system. At least there was cpu load when had terminology focused
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:07:38] there are other "smoothness" issues. probably the canvas redraws dh mentioned. those are for 1.19 if i remember correctly.
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:08:09] just dragging around a window is choppy?
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:08:20] how much cpu usage are you seeing?
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:08:51] no not choppy. i just see increased cpu.
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:09:12] how much cpu?
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:10:33] i'll check again and tell you tomorrow. need to observe it a bit more. HOwever what i remember is that it was a bit more than moving a window around in weston
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:10:56] if there is a way to precicely measure things like that let me know

2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:11:18] maybe it's just evas being heavier than weston's toy scenegraph :/
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:11:41] could be. what i noticed to load the cpu was changing between virtual desktops
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ManMower	[15:11:52] I'm in software render mode right now,  nothing happening but terminology's blinking cursor.  4% cpu all spent in _evas_rendeR_phase1_object_process
2016-09-06 20:32:51	ApBBB	[15:12:21] how you measure that?

2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[14:59:25] also it'll be implemented as wp_viewporter, I don't know if we'll ever impl wl_scaler
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[14:59:32] gst will be updated to use wp_viewporter instead
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[14:59:39] I assume you're testing git gst
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[14:59:47] because that's where I ran into trouble with it not existing
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[14:59:47] ok gst-play wasn't working and gave me a message related to that
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[14:59:56] gst from the repos
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:00:05] arch
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:00:08] yeah, recent gst tries to use wl_scaler even if it doesn't need it.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:00:10] some bullshit.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:00:12] 1.8.3
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:01:05] ok. There is a bigger problem with video though. Using vaapi (fuck wrong instruction in wikis :( ) i get choppy video on both wayland and X
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:02:01] maybe someone else can help, but if it's choppy on X it's outside of my area of effect
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:02:38] could also be a HW issue. :/
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:02:45] indeed
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:02:46] no idea how to find out about this
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:02:55] gst probably has a support #
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:03:08] the gst guys I know are really great
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:03:29] i'll give it a try tomorrow
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:04:23] BTW some of the peformance issues i am seeing in Wayland are from terminology pointer blinking. you were working on that right?
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:04:56] yeah.  for normal systems that's not a problem anymore. ;)
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:05:03] what I'm working on now might resolve it for you too
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:05:28] is it fixed in git? because i am on 1.18 on the main system
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:05:41] oh.  should be.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:06:04] I think it was fixed on 1.18
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:06:42] hmmm. i see it on the main system. At least there was cpu load when had terminology focused
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:07:38] there are other "smoothness" issues. probably the canvas redraws dh mentioned. those are for 1.19 if i remember correctly.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:08:09] just dragging around a window is choppy?
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:08:20] how much cpu usage are you seeing?
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:08:51] no not choppy. i just see increased cpu.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:09:12] how much cpu?
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:10:33] i'll check again and tell you tomorrow. need to observe it a bit more. HOwever what i remember is that it was a bit more than moving a window around in weston
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:10:56] if there is a way to precicely measure things like that let me know
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:11:02] hehe nope
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:11:18] maybe it's just evas being heavier than weston's toy scenegraph :/
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:11:41] could be. what i noticed to load the cpu was changing between virtual desktops
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:11:52] I'm in software render mode right now,  nothing happening but terminology's blinking cursor.  4% cpu all spent in _evas_rendeR_phase1_object_process
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:12:21] how you measure that?
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:12:27] perf
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:12:30] sudo perf top
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:12:38] (logged in via ssh so it's not causing any draws in the E session)
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:13:05] arrg i need a second machine that works properly.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:13:50] the 32bit machine is not suitable for sshing into stuff. (keyboard somehow broken making typing things a nightmare)
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:14:15] or at least i need a second keyboard :P
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:14:25] hehe
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:16:38] there was another perf command you mentioned some time ago that was working per app. what was that again?
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:17:09] perf record
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ApBBB	[15:17:28] thanks
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:17:55] np
2016-09-06 20:42:23	ManMower	[15:18:18] that makes a file called perf.data  you can view the reesults with perf report

2016-09-07 00:00:39	Simotek	hmm interesting raster e17 fails to build with the latest efl due to theme issues (probably all the pushing I need to drop it)
2016-09-07 00:01:14	AJSlye	e17
2016-09-07 00:01:25	Simotek	yeah not e21
2016-09-07 00:01:30	AJSlye	hmm
2016-09-07 00:01:51	AJSlye	interesting.
2016-09-07 00:02:23	Simotek	AJSlye, when e18 was released given I was renaming the old package from e17->enlightenment I decided to just keep e17 still as e18 had some regressions
2016-09-07 00:02:43	Simotek	its continued to build without me touching it since so i've not dropped it
2016-09-07 00:02:46	AJSlye	I understand completely.
2016-09-07 00:03:24	Simotek	for the last year or so i've more kept it as its more effort to remove it then just leave it there
2016-09-07 00:03:53	AJSlye	that's the part I find interesting actually. That it continued to build.
2016-09-07 00:04:31	AJSlye	try compiling plasma 4 on qt5.
2016-09-07 00:04:41	AJSlye	not going to hapen easily
2016-09-07 00:04:46	AJSlye	happen
2016-09-07 00:04:58	AJSlye	whatever need more hot tea
2016-09-07 00:05:05	Simotek	I kept the old e_dbus package but other then that no "efl 1 release breaks backwards compatibility so it hsould still work"
2016-09-07 00:05:26	Simotek	well I wouldn't expect it to build on efl 2.0
2016-09-07 00:05:28	AJSlye	nice
2016-09-07 00:05:54	Simotek	I would expect the first ever plasma 5 release should still build with the latest Qt5 release
2016-09-07 00:06:40	AJSlye	Manjaro still has e_dbus 1.7.10 in thoer repo for some odd reason.
2016-09-07 00:06:42	Simotek	Qt also keeps the same promise across major versions (gtk doesn't do as good a job), but kde4 to kde5 was a change in major Qt version
2016-09-07 00:06:58	AJSlye	right
2016-09-07 00:07:15	Simotek	AJSlye, e17 is the only thing I know of that uses that e_dbus
2016-09-07 00:07:22	AJSlye	I know more about QT and KF5 than I do about most things
2016-09-07 00:08:01	AJSlye	I know, and it e17 hasn't been inn the repo for a long long time.
2016-09-07 00:08:02	Simotek	eldbus was introduced in efl 1.8 as a replacement for e_dbus, e18 was ported to use it instead but it was after the e17 release
2016-09-07 00:08:16	AJSlye	Yea, I know
2016-09-07 00:08:31	Simotek	AJSlye, prior to this year I was a embedded Qt application developer
2016-09-07 00:09:02	AJSlye	Simotek, I was the maintainer of the NetrunnerRolling Edition.
2016-09-07 00:09:08	AJSlye	;)
2016-09-07 00:09:37	AJSlye	Might still be, still don't know if it is going to be completely droped yet or not.
2016-09-07 00:10:22	AJSlye	I was just asked to work on something else which a can't talk about until a decision on NRR was made.
2016-09-07 00:10:42	AJSlye	has nothing to do with E though.
2016-09-07 00:10:56	AJSlye	this is my own thing.

2016-09-07 00:20:57	AJSlye	If lxqt could come up with a wm of it's own and combine thier gtk 2 and 3 configuration apps into one. I think they would have an over the top winner.
2016-09-07 00:21:50	Simotek	well eventually they'll get to all that in Qt
2016-09-07 00:21:57	AJSlye	but having to set colors and icons etc. in two diferent places is anoting as hell.

2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:05:06] Simotek: and theme - one of our corectness checks is saying something is wrong? edje_cc has become stricter over time.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:07:28] swiftgeek: coreboot? really no idea. if its very posixy and fairly featureful - it likely would be possible.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	swiftgeek	[01:08:23] not really featureful, it's just that libpayload :P
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:10:43] welll input devices? some kind of fb controls/access?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:11:03] i assume a driver abstraction/layer for that
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:11:25] a filesystem? threading? multiple processes (or well threads that acs as procs)?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	swiftgeek	[01:21:09] well multiple processes are out of scope for that ^^, as for filesystem i think only cbfs is supported (which sits in flash)
2016-09-07 02:15:22	swiftgeek	[01:22:09] input devices are handled by libpayload as well, and framebuffer is just set during hwinit and it usually ends up being just memory region to write to in specific format (like rgb888)
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:26:59] well A filesystem of some sort
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:27:14] so no threads?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	swiftgeek	[01:42:16] i guess so
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:43:31] hmm thats going to suck then for efl. we're adding more and more
2016-09-07 02:15:22	swiftgeek	[01:45:57] so i guess that some kind of rtos is now required?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:51:55] yes
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:53:02] a scheduler for threads at least. i/o (a filesystem for files), display ( a basic fb will do or the ability to double-buffer and swap 2fb's) with some kind of  rgb888 or rgb565 or rgb332 (8bit) or whatever and yes input devices
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:53:27] well a libc - malloc etc. stuff tho we could implement our own
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:53:41] in fact i'm mulling if we should not just have our own allocator anyway
2016-09-07 02:15:22	swiftgeek	[01:56:31] so we are missing "only" scheduler ^^
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:59:56] i guess
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[01:59:59] if the rest is there
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@raster	[02:00:31] it can be as dumd as a round-robin scheduler with simple yeild/known sleeping states to skip sleeping threads
2016-09-07 02:15:22	archfae	[02:12:26] Any notion how to disable/remoive this "gadget" called 'Bryce'?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	archfae	[02:13:08] Added it to my desktop because I was curious; looks like a shelf, but is not editable or configurable like a normal shelf.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	swiftgeek	[02:15:07] raster: speaking of threads, while in wayland mouse/pretty much everything freezes on application menu load

2016-09-07 02:16:19	@raster	its fixable
2016-09-07 02:16:57	@raster	probably partly the icon header loads (which involve for svg's forking a child process and talking to it via stdin/out)
2016-09-07 02:17:13	@raster	and maaaybe some efreet stuff tho it should be cached and in memory already in the efret db
2016-09-07 02:17:27	@raster	we currently cant/dont split header loads off from body
2016-09-07 02:21:16	archfae	Found it in phab issue description. Use Alt+Right-click to get context menu. I had to close all contained modules before it would "remove" gracefully.

2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:08:10] raster: one question since you are around. How does the emotion gstreamer backend chooses what gstreamer sink to use (ie xvimagesink waylandsink or whatever)?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:08:42] ApBBB: we have our own sink
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:08:59] emotion_sink.c
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:13:52] yes but that is e specific. from what i understand gstreamer uses playbin which has a way of selecting what that will use. does e uses this in any way?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:14:18] in playbin you can force a sink.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:14:20] we set up a specific sink for emotion because we need a specific sink
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:14:26] we cannot have other sinks work
2016-09-07 09:43:19	swiftgeek	[09:14:32] raster: but it wouldn't be impossible to optimize it for static compilation right?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:14:33] i dont know beyond that
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:14:55] swiftgeek: only what is used - but thats not actyually possible because of eo :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:15:04] ok thanks.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:15:21] as not everything is indirected and function ptrs are all referenced in class data for classes
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:15:24] so EVERYTHING is used
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:15:42] you wont magically strip out unused stuff as any tool would see it all used
2016-09-07 09:43:19	swiftgeek	[09:21:41] so optimizing it would involve bigger changes that would break API/ABI?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:22:13] well you'd have to by hand remvoe classes and know exactly what inherits/links to /uses what
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:22:36] it really isnt built for minimizing to a small static thing
2016-09-07 09:43:19	bu5hm4n	[09:28:10] ApBBB: what are you trying to do?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:28:29] to see what the fuck is wrong with HW acceleration in X
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:30:25] on previews -with gstvaapi enabled- it plays choppy video and fucks up the thumbnailing. If you remove gst-vaapi everything works fine. However on X if you use gst-play-1.0 it plays just fine.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:30:38] waylant is another painfull story :(
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:31:10] gst-play with HW accel through vaapi
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:31:20] gst has a vaapisink which is used
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:31:37] raster: J have an eastetics question about rage.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	bu5hm4n	[09:31:42] ApBBB: uaaaaaf
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:32:08] if you use xvimagesink in gst play it is choppy the exact same way E previes behave
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:32:25] there is a xpeaker icon that does nothing, is rage to eventually have a seperate volume control?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:32:29] speaker
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:32:44] AJSlye: not implemented yet afaik
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:33:12] AJSlye:  yes. that was/is the plan
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:33:24] cool, the other question why a wrench for the about popup?

2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:33:47] I see a wrench i thing configuartion dialog.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:33:48] not done yet
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:33:54] correct
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:33:59] ah, cool. carry on.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:34:21] BTW, the last realease seems to fix the video playback issues I was having.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:34:54] not sure if that's rage itself or the fact I reworked my efl PKGBUILD.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:35:43] but I used to have issues with some formats not working at all, and others half the window was curupt with blue wash.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:36:07] now every video I have works flawlessly.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:36:48] Great job,
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:36:51] :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@raster	[09:37:16] it always worked flawlessly for me :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:37:43] Yea, like I said strange issue, probably releated to my new build of EFL
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:38:12] I had to re-install my whole system so I took time out to clean up the pkgbuild
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:40:07] Anyway, nice jod none the less
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ApBBB	[09:40:19] holy mfucking cpu burn with 4k and rage :s
2016-09-07 09:43:19	AJSlye	[09:40:22] rrr job, too early morning need more coffee

2016-09-07 09:43:38	@raster	ApBBB:  u'll likelty find gst-playbin uses the same cpu
2016-09-07 09:45:55	@raster	it also depends on the codec and file
2016-09-07 09:45:58	@raster	opn some its just fine
2016-09-07 09:46:27	@raster	i can play 4k video as a wallpaper without much trouble - maybe 20% or so used by cpu for one file
2016-09-07 09:46:29	@raster	so it depends
2016-09-07 09:48:56	ApBBB	raster: having rage do its thumbnailing thing (see rage thumb and evas image load in top) makes moving windows around in the screen choppy
2016-09-07 09:49:27	@raster	slow enough machine
2016-09-07 09:49:30	@raster	not much i can do

2016-09-07 09:55:12	@raster	because i gave u the raw image not the link to the webpage?

2016-09-07 09:57:21	AJSlye	here, still waking up
2016-09-07 09:57:48	ApBBB	the cause of the window choppines when movin them while rage thumbnails is result of gstreamer-vaapi

2016-09-07 09:57:57	ApBBB	fuck yeah
2016-09-07 09:58:58	ApBBB	and it seems that it uses less cpu without hwaccel :/

2016-09-07 10:13:07	AJSlye	yes but radeon or amdgpu?
2016-09-07 10:13:23	ApBBB	radeon. no amdgpu for this generation of HW
2016-09-07 10:13:42	ApBBB	need an rx480
2016-09-07 10:13:43	AJSlye	?
2016-09-07 10:13:49	AJSlye	rrr ;)
2016-09-07 10:14:22	ApBBB	amdgpu works on the latest stuff and SI HW. which is 7xxx series

2016-09-07 10:15:46	AJSlye	?
2016-09-07 10:16:01	ApBBB	its a parameter to get HW accel to work
2016-09-07 10:16:15	ApBBB	it doesn't need it on X but does on Wayland
2016-09-07 10:16:30	AJSlye	No I meant do you have the  libva-mesa-driver package installed?
2016-09-07 10:16:39	ApBBB	yes
2016-09-07 10:18:17	ApBBB	HA found a video file rage cant play
2016-09-07 10:18:49	@raster	and gst-play  can?
2016-09-07 10:18:50	ApBBB	and neither does vlc
2016-09-07 10:19:19	ApBBB	gst play works
2016-09-07 10:19:28	@raster	interesting
2016-09-07 10:19:30	@raster	odd
2016-09-07 10:19:30	AJSlye	Yea, I had a few of those that now work with 0.2.1 but didn't woth 0.2.0 or git last week.
2016-09-07 10:19:35	ApBBB	http://distribution.bbb3d.renderfarming.net/video/mp4/bbb_sunflower_2160p_60fps_normal.mp4 in case you care
2016-09-07 10:19:36	@raster	it should be the same as gst-play
2016-09-07 10:19:52	@raster	as its the same codecs and meda engine
2016-09-07 10:19:54	@raster	media
2016-09-07 10:20:10	@raster	0.2.1 changed nothing to do with video

2016-09-07 10:20:48	@raster	it just tells emotion the uri and waits for callbacks to tellit of events
2016-09-07 10:20:48	AJSlye	Yea, I realize that.
2016-09-07 10:21:07	ApBBB	the efm thumbnailer worked with it the one in rage didn't
2016-09-07 10:21:14	AJSlye	rage uses the gstreamer backend though doesn't it?
2016-09-07 10:21:40	@raster	yes
2016-09-07 10:21:48	AJSlye	or does it let emotion take care of that?
2016-09-07 10:22:11	AJSlye	I ask becouse i did enable xine in my pkgbuild for emotion.
2016-09-07 10:22:38	@raster	emotion take care of it all
2016-09-07 10:22:50	AJSlye	Ahh, that could be it then.
2016-09-07 10:23:09	AJSlye	might be using xine for the ones gstreamer wont play.
2016-09-07 10:23:29	@raster	all rage does by default is say "use gstreamer1"
2016-09-07 10:23:31	@raster	as the engine
2016-09-07 10:23:39	@raster	emotion may say "no"
2016-09-07 10:23:45	AJSlye	or even vlc if it's falling to generic players.
2016-09-07 10:23:46	@raster	and use some other module if that doesnt exist
2016-09-07 10:24:04	@raster	and not
2016-09-07 10:24:13	@raster	it wont switch engine based on codec
2016-09-07 10:24:19	AJSlye	hmm
2016-09-07 10:24:29	@raster	it'll use that backend regardless if it understands it or not
2016-09-07 10:24:32	AJSlye	anyway, some didn't play before now they do.
2016-09-07 10:24:37	@raster	if the module doesnt know - it'll fail
2016-09-07 10:25:01	AJSlye	could have been an update to gstreamer to.
2016-09-07 10:25:36	@raster	that would affect stuff
2016-09-07 10:28:15	AJSlye	 ApBBB: gstreamer-vaapi would be for gstreamer 0.10 would it not?
2016-09-07 10:28:31	ApBBB	No. gst1. E needs a HW accelerated backend with no buffers (or whatever) being copied around wasting CPU.
2016-09-07 10:28:44	ApBBB	and i need a long walk.
2016-09-07 10:28:58	AJSlye	nevermind, do you also have gst-libva installed?
2016-09-07 10:30:10	ApBBB	dont see a package like that on Arch
2016-09-07 10:30:30	ApBBB	oh wait
2016-09-07 10:30:44	AJSlye	https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=gst-libav
2016-09-07 10:31:17	AJSlye	that might work better than vaapi
2016-09-07 10:31:39	ApBBB	nothing i use needs it as a dep
2016-09-07 10:31:53	ApBBB	if i don't use hw acceleration things work ok
2016-09-07 10:32:26	AJSlye	That would be a hw acceleration plugin for gst

2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[12:55:09] that is the least of its problems
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[12:55:38] i mean gst-play has to have a working vaapisink on wayland which is dependant on radeon implementing whats missing.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:55:40] it's the one I can directly fix though :(
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[12:55:52] didn't complain
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[12:56:07] just described the situation
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:56:13] nod
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:56:16] me too :)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:56:19] well I complained
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:56:21] hehe
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[12:56:39] anyway this will make gst-play-1.0 work on wayland which is a start
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[12:57:00] at least for intel HW i expect it to work
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:57:04] yeah
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[12:58:18] i also tested the rage bug (t3451) on the main system. Same result as on the crap one. Meaning we have a problem in EFL somewhere. :/
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:58:52] yeah
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:58:55] that's a problem :/
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:59:14] almost certainly my problem to fix it
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:59:35] thanks for adding me to the ticket
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[12:59:44] i just did it to piss you :P
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[12:59:52] that's my constant state anyway
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:04:23] the good news is that wayland doesn't crash much. the only crashes i noticed were with misconfigured gstreamer stuff (which IMO should fail more gracefully -ie this doesn't work >do nothing) but thats a minor thing.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:05:42] so leaving out nvidia DND an Xwayland fix that needs to get in stable from git and a related bug we are in a quite good situation.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[13:12:12] awesome :)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[13:12:28] the gstreamer stuff actually crashes the compositor?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[13:12:52] oh that one takes out your whole pc doesn't it?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:15:36] if its wrongly configured (can't find the driver) it will freeze. if you have it with the vdpayu wrapper (which will go away AFAIK) if restarts
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:15:56] freeze needs an ssh and killall -9 enlightenment or hard reboot
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:16:10] but thats a configuration issue.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[13:17:33] ahh ok, thought it was a more serious kind of freeze
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[13:17:37] yeah that's e or efl
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:18:27] oh. i have to test for the freeze i see on the old machine.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:18:57] t2599
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:19:00] brb
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AJSlye	[13:19:34] kuuko: that fixed the crash but do get an error about repopening the torent
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AJSlye	[13:20:15] [ERROR] Opening torrent 8ef4183b5dfe6ffc5b4d7336680ca01e88c60c88 failed

2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[13:33:05] Oddly enough t2599 is unreproducable on the main machine. I suspect the Xwayland module start fast enough there to not cause the preview to crash. :/
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AJSlye	[13:35:38] kuuko: it also no londer completely exits
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AJSlye	[13:36:35] maybe we should just wait on libtorrent-raster 1.1.1

2016-09-07 17:22:11	ApBBB	[17:06:32] or draftsight?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[17:07:45] CaptFrito: is it actually a window left behind?  can xkill get rid of it? :)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	CaptFrito	[17:07:48] nope, evolution in this particular case
2016-09-07 17:22:11	CaptFrito	[17:08:25] no it's just some screen fragment, no window at all, even an enlightenment restart wont fix it
2016-09-07 17:22:11	CaptFrito	[17:08:59] it statys even if i switch virtual desktops
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[17:09:05] O.o
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[17:09:15] so you can be in text mode with a chunk of evolution over the top?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ManMower	[17:09:20] oh, desktops

2016-09-07 17:42:27	CaptFrito	ManMower: yep there's like a 100x150pixel chunk left over from something that was there -- it's not a window, just a square region. it's persistent and always on top/overwrites everything
2016-09-07 17:43:02	ManMower	no idea how it can be not-a-window and still be persistent over an E restart
2016-09-07 17:44:56	CaptFrito	ManMower: me either, that's why i was asking, must be somethin lower level in X or maybe even in the nvidia buffers, but i dont undertand how it overwrites everything
2016-09-07 17:45:16	CaptFrito	i have seen this before, and it always takes a restart f X to clear it

2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[12:56:07] just described the situation
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:56:13] nod
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:56:16] me too :)
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:56:19] well I complained
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:56:21] hehe
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[12:56:39] anyway this will make gst-play-1.0 work on wayland which is a start
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[12:57:00] at least for intel HW i expect it to work
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:57:04] yeah
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[12:58:18] i also tested the rage bug (t3451) on the main system. Same result as on the crap one. Meaning we have a problem in EFL somewhere. :/
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:58:52] yeah
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:58:55] that's a problem :/
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:59:14] almost certainly my problem to fix it
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:59:35] thanks for adding me to the ticket
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[12:59:44] i just did it to piss you :P
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[12:59:52] that's my constant state anyway
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:04:23] the good news is that wayland doesn't crash much. the only crashes i noticed were with misconfigured gstreamer stuff (which IMO should fail more gracefully -ie this doesn't work >do nothing) but thats a minor thing.
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:05:42] so leaving out nvidia DND an Xwayland fix that needs to get in stable from git and a related bug we are in a quite good situation.
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[13:12:12] awesome :)
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[13:12:28] the gstreamer stuff actually crashes the compositor?
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[13:12:52] oh that one takes out your whole pc doesn't it?
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:15:36] if its wrongly configured (can't find the driver) it will freeze. if you have it with the vdpayu wrapper (which will go away AFAIK) if restarts
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:15:56] freeze needs an ssh and killall -9 enlightenment or hard reboot
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:16:10] but thats a configuration issue.
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[13:17:33] ahh ok, thought it was a more serious kind of freeze
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ManMower	[13:17:37] yeah that's e or efl
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:18:27] oh. i have to test for the freeze i see on the old machine.
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:18:57] t2599
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:19:00] brb
2016-09-07 21:02:39	AJSlye	[13:19:34] kuuko: that fixed the crash but do get an error about repopening the torent
2016-09-07 21:02:39	AJSlye	[13:20:15] [ERROR] Opening torrent 8ef4183b5dfe6ffc5b4d7336680ca01e88c60c88 failed
2016-09-07 21:02:39	AJSlye	[13:20:23] but atleast it reopens
2016-09-07 21:02:39	ApBBB	[13:33:05] Oddly enough t2599 is unreproducable on the main machine. I suspect the Xwayland module start fast enough there to not cause the preview to crash. :/
2016-09-07 21:02:39	AJSlye	[13:35:38] kuuko: it also no londer completely exits
2016-09-07 21:02:39	AJSlye	[13:36:35] maybe we should just wait on libtorrent-raster 1.1.1

2016-09-08 00:23:12	AJSlye	I guess if you realy like kontact (Kmail) you could install it and have akonadi started for it at login.
2016-09-08 00:23:27	MrDowntempo	Well that's disconcerting :(
2016-09-08 00:23:33	AJSlye	or baloo for dolphin,
2016-09-08 00:23:40	AJSlye	but why
2016-09-08 00:24:11	AJSlye	kio
2016-09-08 00:24:27	MrDowntempo	The options are there, but I can't find any documentation on them on the website or various wikis. I'd be willing to use them if I knew what they did and if what they offered was a more complete DE.
2016-09-08 00:24:29	AJSlye	that one would actually be nice for some things
2016-09-08 00:25:18	AJSlye	basically if the services are installed that setting will load them on startup as if gnome or plasma was running.
2016-09-08 00:25:55	AJSlye	aka convince the service it was running natively in it's own enviroment.
2016-09-08 00:26:02	AJSlye	I might be wrong though.
2016-09-08 00:26:09	AJSlye	never used it.
2016-09-08 00:26:34	MrDowntempo	There's some stuff that is incomplete or buggy or missing in E that gnome/kde offers. I had KDE installed on the machine, and so enabled the kde checkbox, but haven't seen any real visible difference. I'd be willing to switch to gnoem but I'd want to be sure of what advantages I was getting, and if they were in anyway buggy too
2016-09-08 00:26:41	AJSlye	other than the gnome key ring which can be started via startup applications.
2016-09-08 00:27:43	MrDowntempo	Stuff like a more complete clipboard manager, a working system tray. A bluetooth widget that wasn't incompatible with my current E install etc.
2016-09-08 00:28:00	AJSlye	if kwallet it installed I suppose that setting would enable it.
2016-09-08 00:28:18	MrDowntempo	It might, but I haven't used kwallet at all yet
2016-09-08 00:28:38	AJSlye	none of those are services.
2016-09-08 00:28:46	MrDowntempo	My desktop setup is still very in the works :)
2016-09-08 00:29:06	AJSlye	that system tray works fine for freedesktop appindicators
2016-09-08 00:29:28	AJSlye	if you really need xembed, the stanalonetray is the go to.
2016-09-08 00:29:38	MrDowntempo	bluetooth is a service (if I understand correctly) It's a systemd service
2016-09-08 00:30:24	MrDowntempo	Yeah, I"ve read that. Haven't gotten around to installing it yet. That's probably next on my todo
2016-09-08 00:30:35	AJSlye	not exactly, bluez and bluedevil, etc. are services that systemd is aware of, but what your talking about is a applet to control it yes.
2016-09-08 00:31:17	MrDowntempo	Yes. But I asssumed that KDE and Gnome's apps interfaced with it, and perhaps that was what the checkbox was refering to
2016-09-08 00:31:45	AJSlye	recompile networkmanager with enable indicator and nm-applet will work in the enlightenment system tray.
2016-09-08 00:32:09	MrDowntempo	I've been using connman, not network-manager.

2016-09-08 00:32:31	AJSlye	plasma uses it's own applet
2016-09-08 00:33:19	AJSlye	is it only bluetooth that is an issue with conman for you?
2016-09-08 00:33:27	AJSlye	connman
2016-09-08 00:33:27	MrDowntempo	I havent been able to get econnman working properly though. One of the dependencies fails to build
2016-09-08 00:33:36	AJSlye	which one?
2016-09-08 00:33:40	AJSlye	what distro
2016-09-08 00:33:46	MrDowntempo	Bluetooth has been an issue all around for me. Probably not e related though.
2016-09-08 00:33:54	MrDowntempo	Arch-ARM
2016-09-08 00:34:01	AJSlye	bluetooth in e requires bluez4
2016-09-08 00:34:08	AJSlye	not bluez5
2016-09-08 00:34:10	MrDowntempo	yeah. Which is a bummer.

2016-09-08 00:34:40	AJSlye	really, with what kind of device?
2016-09-08 00:34:42	--	morle is now known as morlenxus
2016-09-08 00:34:53	AJSlye	ie what are you trying to pair with.
2016-09-08 00:35:56	AJSlye	I'm using a bluetooth mouse, never could get audio devices like my bluetooth speakers to work though.
2016-09-08 00:36:08	MrDowntempo	It's a chromebook flip. (lovely little thing) That has integrated bluetooth. I'm trying to pair with a bluetooth mouse (device only has 2 usb ports, so using that usb receiver kinda sucks). It will pair and work for a few minutes but then the bluetooth controller powers off and disappears. I cant re-enable it with bluethoothctl, but it works again on reboot
2016-09-08 00:36:23	AJSlye	but that's on my Maui 1 install

2016-09-08 00:38:52	MrDowntempo	The form factor is exactly what I wanted. But yeah, I don't like the chromeos, and I do wish the keyboard had a few more keys. It uses a rockchip with a Mali 730? or 740? or something like that. It's a pretty beefy GPU considering, but only supports GLES. That's mainly why I'm using E and putting it through it's paces. It has a bluetooth chip integrated which works fine in ChromeOS and works well for a few minutes in arch. I've not 
2016-09-08 00:38:54	MrDowntempo	chip though
2016-09-08 00:38:59	AJSlye	oops wrong window
2016-09-08 00:39:28	MrDowntempo	hehe :)
2016-09-08 00:40:26	AJSlye	I have guake installed on my E and use exit still. I know f12, but i'm a creature of habit
2016-09-08 00:40:49	AJSlye	btw, works in the tray.
2016-09-08 00:41:08	AJSlye	as does pamac now.
2016-09-08 00:41:13	MrDowntempo	Anyway. That's more a hardware/arch issue. I'm liking a lot about E, but it's very much different than most other DEs so I'm still adjusting. Love terminology. Some of the windows open with the widgets layed out weird and stuff like that. Getting a nice looking cosistent theme is a little bit of a hasslel, but I'lll put that off until I get everything else working nice. I haven't even started on sound yet. :)
2016-09-08 00:41:17	MrDowntempo	What is pamac?
2016-09-08 00:41:18	AJSlye	both are appindicator supported apps.
2016-09-08 00:42:03	AJSlye	you know you can use terminology without E right.
2016-09-08 00:42:26	AJSlye	not really
2016-09-08 00:43:11	AJSlye	well qt5 is still a pain as of qt 5.7
2016-09-08 00:43:36	Simotek	Qt5 is fine its the KDE specific stuff thats borked
2016-09-08 00:43:38	AJSlye	they moved it's gtk compatability out of qt5-base
2016-09-08 00:43:40	MrDowntempo	Sure but.. seems silly. There's decent terminal emus for all the major desktop environments
2016-09-08 00:43:56	AJSlye	true
2016-09-08 00:45:13	MrDowntempo	I have lxqt installed too with kwin, as that's the only other gles accelerated environment. I tried getting plasma running, but nothing I could do would make it not graphically glitch out awfully. E has been the best experience so far. LXQT is really nice, but isn't as feature complete as I'd like. And even there, QT and Kwin are a bit more buggy graphically than E is
2016-09-08 00:45:22	AJSlye	qt5 can no longer follow gtk themes without adding an unrealesed package, changing some settings, and installing qt5ct
2016-09-08 00:47:22	AJSlye	QGtkStyle has been removed from qt5-base 5.7.0
2016-09-08 00:47:36	MrDowntempo	I installed the package that was supposed to make QT use GTK themes. Works fine in lxqt. Doesn't work in E which is strance. I tried reseting the gtk and qt themes in various places. It sometimes uses the qrong gtk theme. Strange. I'll probably just get rid of all my QT stuff once I'm satisfied with my E setup
2016-09-08 00:48:12	AJSlye	you need to install  qt5-styleplugins and qt5ct
2016-09-08 00:48:49	AJSlye	then add an eviroment variable
2016-09-08 00:49:06	AJSlye	like I said PIA
2016-09-08 00:49:20	MrDowntempo	All which I've done
2016-09-08 00:49:22	Simotek	AJSlye, if you set the environment var you don't need qt5ct, and i'm pretty sure I patched e to set that env var
2016-09-08 00:49:35	<--	GrannyGoose (~GrannyGoo@CPE-121-214-24-124.lnse3.win.bigpond.net.au) has quit (Quit: Leaving)

2016-09-08 00:49:45	Simotek	yeah
2016-09-08 00:49:58	AJSlye	in 0.18 or 0.19?
2016-09-08 00:50:00	Simotek	so that changing the application theme in e applies to kde apps as well
2016-09-08 00:50:12	MrDowntempo	I put the env variable in .barshrc, when that didn't work, I used the env variable tool in e's settings which works sort of, but often I still end up with the wrong theme, like it's lagged behind an old choice. Like you said. PIA
2016-09-08 00:50:16	Simotek	AJSlye, either in 0.20 or 0.21
2016-09-08 00:50:19	MrDowntempo	I'm on .17
2016-09-08 00:50:21	AJSlye	oops
2016-09-08 00:50:35	AJSlye	i meant git
2016-09-08 00:50:48	MrDowntempo	I couldn't get .18 to run properly after I built it myself.
2016-09-08 00:50:59	AJSlye	I'm on 0.21.2
2016-09-08 00:51:07	Simotek	as am I, I think
2016-09-08 00:51:29	AJSlye	strange qt4 is working right but not qt5
2016-09-08 00:51:32	MrDowntempo	aur says elementary package was integrated into the enlightenment package, but removing elementary resulted in e not loading :(
2016-09-08 00:51:37	Simotek	i'm guessing that i'm on Qt5.7 with the qgtk but i'm checking
2016-09-08 00:51:57	Simotek	MrDowntempo, elementary is intergrated into efl 1.18
2016-09-08 00:52:25	AJSlye	when I load qt5ct it complains about the env not bieng set
2016-09-08 00:52:34	Simotek	i'm waiting for my package manager
2016-09-08 00:52:43	AJSlye	huh
2016-09-08 00:53:16	Simotek	QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2
2016-09-08 00:53:16	MrDowntempo	That's what I meant :3 I had efl and enlightenment built froum source though abs, but still it required the old .17 elementary package to load the desktop. I may have messed something up in the process but.. It's working now in .17 anyway so I'mma wait till there's features I need in a new release before going through that agian
2016-09-08 00:53:46	Simotek	building the e17 theme is broken with the latest edje
2016-09-08 00:53:52	AJSlye	MrDowntempo: use my pkgbuilds.
2016-09-08 00:54:18	AJSlye	but efl 1.18 is already in arch
2016-09-08 00:54:27	MrDowntempo	Will they uninstall my current installs and overwrite them? or do I need to do that myself first?
2016-09-08 00:54:51	Simotek	AJSlye, ./src/bin/e_main.c:343:   e_util_env_set("QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME", "gtk2");
2016-09-08 00:55:23	MrDowntempo	And can you gimmie a link?
2016-09-08 00:56:15	AJSlye	well efl 0.18 will not includes elem, evas loaders and emotion players so they will need to be removed.
2016-09-08 00:56:53	AJSlye	Simotek: is that in e or efl?
2016-09-08 00:57:00	Simotek	e
2016-09-08 00:57:14	Simotek	thats the e21 branch
2016-09-08 00:57:20	AJSlye	git or stable branch or both.
2016-09-08 00:57:44	Simotek	would be anything in the e21 stable branch or master
2016-09-08 00:58:04	Simotek	that was checking the e21 branch in git, because its what I checked out
2016-09-08 00:58:26	Simotek	ahhh no Qt5.7 here yet
2016-09-08 00:58:43	AJSlye	I used the tarball for e.
2016-09-08 00:58:58	AJSlye	stable git branch for efl
2016-09-08 00:59:35	AJSlye	I should probably use the stable branch for e as well to catch those bug fixes that land there.
2016-09-08 00:59:46	AJSlye	then make point releases
2016-09-08 00:59:52	AJSlye	hmm.
2016-09-08 01:00:15	AJSlye	anyway, yes they broke the gtk bit in 5.7
2016-09-08 01:01:24	Simotek	i'm hoping my distro's kde people do it right like they normally do
2016-09-08 01:02:15	AJSlye	5.6 still has qgtkstyle
2016-09-08 01:02:59	Simotek	yeah
2016-09-08 01:03:08	Simotek	i'm guessing that it will still get packaged here
2016-09-08 01:03:43	AJSlye	I have vlc-nightly here and can't get it to theme.
2016-09-08 01:05:39	AJSlye	so if QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE='gtk2'is set then why is it not working.?
2016-09-08 01:06:39	AJSlye	I'm getting this: http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-57d0f1cfbd1663.80903766.jpg
2016-09-08 01:06:54	MrDowntempo	AJSlye: Can you point me to your packageblds? Or are they in AUR?
2016-09-08 01:07:05	AJSlye	efl 1.18.0 and E 0.21.2
2016-09-08 01:07:22	Simotek	AJSlye, you can test with the "env" terminal command
2016-09-08 01:07:34	AJSlye	OH sorry: https://github.com/NuLogicSystems?tab=repositories
2016-09-08 01:08:01	MrDowntempo	Thank you :)
2016-09-08 01:08:17	AJSlye	yes: QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2 is there.
2016-09-08 01:09:11	MrDowntempo	Oh, that's e17? I was under the impression you were recommending e18 or 20?
2016-09-08 01:09:23	AJSlye	but everywhere I've read including the arch wiki says to add QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE='gtk2' after adding qt5-styleplugins
2016-09-08 01:09:44	AJSlye	what is e17?
2016-09-08 01:09:52	MrDowntempo	oh n/m I'm retarded
2016-09-08 01:10:01	MrDowntempo	I saw e17 theme and assumed
2016-09-08 01:10:07	AJSlye	what looking at my pkgbuild for the theme
2016-09-08 01:10:10	MrDowntempo	I see the version in the enlightenment pkgbuild now
2016-09-08 01:11:09	MrDowntempo	the gtk theme is what I saw (i'm really tired.)
2016-09-08 01:11:36	MrDowntempo	Can I safely install that stuff on top of my current install? Or should I pacman -R enlightenment efl first?
2016-09-08 01:11:55	AJSlye	that's just the name of that theme made by tsujan
2016-09-08 01:12:13	MrDowntempo	Yeah, I got it now. I spoke too soon
2016-09-08 01:13:00	Simotek	AJSlye, vlc could be doing something weird try a different qt app
2016-09-08 01:13:01	MrDowntempo	And do I need to install your PKGBUILDS in a certain order?
2016-09-08 01:13:33	AJSlye	you'll need to remove 'elementary' 'evas_generic_loaders' 'emotion_generic_players' before efl 1.18 will build
2016-09-08 01:13:48	AJSlye	efl then enlightement that would be the order
2016-09-08 01:16:15	AJSlye	but pacman might start complining about terminology etc missing dependancy unless you reinstall those as well.
2016-09-08 01:16:28	AJSlye	but you can deal with that afterwords
2016-09-08 01:16:57	AJSlye	well not 'elementary' 'evas_generic_loaders' 'emotion_generic_players' but terminology etc.
2016-09-08 01:17:46	AJSlye	or you could just upgrade efl from the stable repo.
2016-09-08 01:18:02	AJSlye	it should take care of removing those as well.
2016-09-08 01:18:28	AJSlye	and the only real difference between my pkgbuild and donalds is --enable-xine
2016-09-08 01:19:27	AJSlye	there are a few other min differences but negligable, like not a complete doc set, and mine builds from the stable branch in git so it does get a few bug fixes.
2016-09-08 01:19:50	MrDowntempo	I'll give it a shot
2016-09-08 01:20:07	MrDowntempo	do they already have the cflags for enabling efl?
2016-09-08 01:20:19	AJSlye	what?
2016-09-08 01:20:47	AJSlye	which cflags do you mean?
2016-09-08 01:21:12	AJSlye	mine uses export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fvisibility=hidden"  and export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -fvisibility=hidden"
2016-09-08 01:21:28	AJSlye	Donalds only uses export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fvisibility=hidden"
2016-09-08 01:22:01	MrDowntempo	It's under configure actually, my bad. --enable-egl and --with-opengl=es in the EFL pkgbuild
2016-09-08 01:22:13	MrDowntempo	I also get rid of --disable-neon since my machine has neon
2016-09-08 01:22:44	AJSlye	you can change whatever config flags you want, it's your machine.
2016-09-08 01:23:28	MrDowntempo	I know. I've just noticed some provided PKGBUILDS are already setup that way and others aren't
2016-09-08 01:23:38	AJSlye	I have to package for my soon to be released spin of Manjaro, so I need to be sure it will run for most people.
2016-09-08 01:24:02	AJSlye	not everyone has neon
2016-09-08 01:24:05	AJSlye	so pff
2016-09-08 01:24:09	MrDowntempo	:)
2016-09-08 01:24:21	MrDowntempo	It's the one luxery I'm afforded with this chromebook
2016-09-08 01:24:34	MrDowntempo	and I like that e can take advantage of it (presumably)
2016-09-08 01:27:22	MrDowntempo	What does --enable-xine do?
2016-09-08 01:28:10	MrDowntempo	That's just a media player right?
2016-09-08 01:28:49	Simotek	its a media backend
2016-09-08 01:29:01	Simotek	gstreamer1 is more stable and better so use that instead
2016-09-08 01:29:05	AJSlye	It allows emotion to have xine available as a backend
2016-09-08 01:29:23	AJSlye	as well as gsteamer
2016-09-08 01:29:31	MrDowntempo	I'm a huge VLC fan. Can I get rid of --enable-xine and the gst dependencies? Or is VLC not a very good backend for E?
2016-09-08 01:29:51	AJSlye	that's why vlc is a dep for emotion generic players
2016-09-08 01:30:30	AJSlye	I enabled all three and let you choose in the app, aka teminology etc.
2016-09-08 01:30:40	Simotek	vlc can also be used, but it might need vlc3
2016-09-08 01:30:43	MrDowntempo	But having gstreamer and VLC both seems redundant if I can get away with just VLC?
2016-09-08 01:30:59	AJSlye	http://www.enlightenment.org/ss/e-57d0f78aa1ff24.29071467.jpg
2016-09-08 01:30:59	MrDowntempo	Ah, so it should be safe to remove the fst-plugin-base depend?
2016-09-08 01:31:23	MrDowntempo	gotcha
2016-09-08 01:31:27	Simotek	you could but its probably not hurting
2016-09-08 01:31:40	AJSlye	I wouldn't removing both xine and gsreamer may disable the building of emotion
2016-09-08 01:31:49	MrDowntempo	ok
2016-09-08 01:32:19	AJSlye	neither takes up much room and gives options.
2016-09-08 01:32:29	AJSlye	rrr doesn't
2016-09-08 01:32:48	AJSlye	doesn;t take up much room
2016-09-08 01:33:14	AJSlye	see screen shot
2016-09-08 01:33:24	Simotek	although you'll have to go to elm_config and change the default
2016-09-08 01:33:32	AJSlye	well yea

2016-09-08 10:38:49	Simotek	[07:35:03] alright with any luck when I reboot there will be an option in gdm called "Enlightenment Wayland" and it will launch enlightenment under wayland
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Simotek	[07:35:21] then I will log out and try "Enlightenment" which will launch it under X11

2016-09-08 10:38:49	ApBBB	[08:32:20] nothing to do about it
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ApBBB	[08:33:07] hopefully soon we'll have a proper way (efl based) to log in wayland graphically.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Simotek	[08:34:25] well yeah i'm waiting for the next e release before i go further
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Simotek	[08:34:34] I can't even launch xwayland atm
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ApBBB	[08:36:02] you are testing git or stable
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ApBBB	[08:36:03] ?

2016-09-08 10:38:49	Simotek	[08:40:43] ApBBB, stable atm
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ApBBB	[08:41:29] then xwayland is a matter of just showing up. if you launch an X app you can see a process in systemd-cgls or top
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Simotek	[08:46:19] yeah atm x11 apps just hang when I launch them
2016-09-08 10:38:49	MrDowntempo	[09:20:20] Hey AJSlye, your PKGBUILDS are working like gangbusters :)
2016-09-08 10:38:49	MrDowntempo	[09:22:09] I was already using LightDM too, and then I saw you had an EFL greeter build. I've insalled that as well, and configured lightdm.conf to include the line greeter-session=lightdm-efl-greeter but I'm still seeing the GTK one :(
2016-09-08 10:38:49	MrDowntempo	[09:22:24] EFL and Enlightenment are working though :)
2016-09-08 10:38:49	AJSlye	[09:31:21] Yea, Enter is just a fork that I was planing on themeing for Manjaro and NuLogic but haven't had a chance to play with yet.

2016-09-08 10:38:49	ApBBB	[10:20:47] don't know what night of joy is but from the title of it sounds like adult related. And can't deside -since your son is still in school- if this is top level or low level dadness :P

2016-09-09 09:48:10	@TAsn	[06:37:51] even the most basic refactoring
2016-09-09 09:48:10	@TAsn	[06:37:53] is dangerous
2016-09-09 09:48:10	raster	[06:38:23] welll i refactored the eoid lookup with gotos and got it right first go
2016-09-09 09:48:10	raster	[06:38:26] without make check

2016-09-09 09:48:10	raster	[06:39:55] that is why i wanted this in git earlier
2016-09-09 09:48:10	raster	[06:40:01] i had several reasons
2016-09-09 09:48:10	raster	[06:40:04] jp was pestering
2016-09-09 09:48:10	@TAsn	[06:40:04] hm... unlikely I'll be in rome, but I'll be in london. :)

2016-09-09 09:48:10	Nubink	[08:27:20] ooh... that's interesting... did you update via pacman / yaourt or did you grab from GIT?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	ajwillia_ms	[08:30:04] git - but you should get the same if you get enlightenment-git from yaourt
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Nubink	[08:31:16] OK, just put in enlightenment-git and it is reporting a similar number (21577 on the end of mine - the devs are busy)
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Nubink	[08:31:25] I will give it a go and report back
