2016-09-01 14:20:32	nanonyme	[13:56:35] tortal, did it seriously suggest you to use 3.0 compatibility or did you set that yourself?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tortal	[13:57:08] nanonyme: i set it myself.. but i realize that i should set a higher version when it comes to python3
2016-09-01 14:20:32	_habnabit	[13:57:24] tortal, 2.x and 3.x have been released in parallel, so
2016-09-01 14:20:32	jesopo	[13:57:41] _habnabit how do i python super good
2016-09-01 14:20:32	_habnabit	[13:58:02] tortal, 3.3+ and 2.7.9+ is a good range to target

2016-09-01 14:20:32	_habnabit	[13:58:12] jesopo, answer questions on #python for years
2016-09-01 14:20:32	ELFrederich	[13:58:18] When you guys start a new project, what to you use as your basis?  Is the sample project from the Python Packaging Authority a good one?  https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject
2016-09-01 14:20:32	jesopo	[13:58:23] shit i cant do that
2016-09-01 14:20:32	dude-x	[13:58:27] jesopo do you mean super()?

2016-09-01 14:20:32	tortal	[13:59:51] _habnabit: thanks.. however I am trying to include 2.6.9 as well as it is the default in our systems
2016-09-01 14:20:32	_habnabit	[14:00:09] tortal, what old OS are you using??
2016-09-01 14:20:32	ELFrederich	[14:00:45] hop: right, but it has a layout.  Is that a good one to use?  "tests" directory at the top level along with the main package?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	hop	[14:01:30] ELFrederich: it's one way to do it
2016-09-01 14:20:32	hop	[14:01:38] ELFrederich: do you have an actual problem?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	ChrisWarrick	[14:01:49] just make sure that tests package is not installed
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tortal	[14:01:52] our dev servers use OpenSUSE and most of use SSH/NX when coding.. but i am running debian guest on a local virtual machine when coding myself

2016-09-01 14:20:32	deniska	[14:03:29] If you are developing new software, there's no good excuse not to get 2.7 or 3.5 running
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tortal	[14:03:34] in this company clearcase was alive until few months ago
2016-09-01 14:20:32	KevinMGranger	[14:04:44] If you're writing new software, just got full 3
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tortal	[14:05:16] well. can not use 3 since im using libs that are not yet compatible
2016-09-01 14:20:32	deniska	[14:05:24] I can see why 2.7 might be prefered, but 2.6 is just devops being lazy :)
2016-09-01 14:20:32	_habnabit	[14:05:25] depends on what interop you need
2016-09-01 14:20:32	kurse	[14:14:06] if I have like 8 methods that all repeat very similar code, what is the recommended way to reduce the code repetition? example would be something like this http://pastebin.com/VNSFgUeN

2016-09-01 14:20:32	hop	[14:15:39] kurse: don't have those methods in the first place
2016-09-01 14:20:32	veverak	[14:15:44] put assert type in ['table1', 'table2', 'table3'] before the return

2016-09-01 14:20:32	hop	[14:16:22] kurse: wherever you call get_foo_db() you can as well call get_db_connection directly
2016-09-01 14:20:32	hop	[14:16:29] also don't call methods get_foo
2016-09-01 14:20:32	hop	[14:17:03] it only annoys the dog

2016-09-01 14:20:32	kurse	[14:18:10] lol thanks for the get_foo advice. Yeah I might try and go through this and just call get_db_connection directly in those places. Would it be good to make some constant that held all of the db table names that I could just refer to when calling the get_db_connection method? like get_db_connection(db['primary'], tables['users'])
2016-09-01 14:20:32	mjanssen	[14:18:26] kurse: create def get_primary_db_connection(table):
2016-09-01 14:20:32	ELFrederich	[14:18:37] hop: sorry, went away for a bit.  Yeah, the problem is that we're migrating from a codebase that was based on CMake and I want to have a more standard layout and setup.py so it can work with pip
2016-09-01 14:20:32	veverak	[14:18:48] kurse: depends
2016-09-01 14:20:32	kurse	[14:18:54] mjanssen: what if I have multiple databases though that I connect to often?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	veverak	[14:19:01] kurse: unless actually needed it's useless complexity
2016-09-01 14:20:32	mjanssen	[14:19:25] then you use get_db_connection and put the table names and tables in a dict
2016-09-01 14:20:32	veverak	[14:19:40] kurse: I will give you advice, don't care about it unless you have to
2016-09-01 14:20:32	veverak	[14:19:45] :)
2016-09-01 14:20:32	mjanssen	[14:19:47] you are just reinventing get_db_connection now
2016-09-01 14:20:32	***	Playback Complete.
2016-09-01 14:20:34	kurse	veverak: I do trust me. I am trying to get advice from those wiser than I. I know this code repetition should not be here and I just want the proper way to get rid of it.

2016-09-01 14:39:02	_habnabit	anarchat, so if you're doing this formatting for display, i recommend not using __str__ but making a separate method so you can return unicode on 2 and 3 both. you could make a __unicode__ method and on python 3 alias  __str__ to __unicode
2016-09-01 14:39:03	_habnabit	__
2016-09-01 14:39:15	_habnabit	anarchat, or just do .to_string() or w/e

2016-09-01 14:39:46	_habnabit	anarchat, but if you want to display non-ascii bytes _and_ be 2/3 polyglot compatible, __str__ will not be very useful
2016-09-01 14:39:55	anarchat	right

2016-09-01 21:23:40	SmartAsianGuy	simpson: why didn't the python creator just make Python remember a parameter assignment such as lyrics = self.attribute even after the __init__ thingy? any reason why Python is made so inconvenient that way?

2016-09-01 21:25:24	simpson	SmartAsianGuy: __init__() can be pretty much any function which takes `self` as its first argument. It happens to be the thing that the Python VM calls to instantiate your class.

2016-09-02 14:13:21	damio	[14:09:56] another small question: anybody on debian/ubuntu using python 3.6, is there a repo, binaries or do you compile it yourself ?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	BlaXpirit	[14:10:07] ben_m, last time i did this, i used Qt, basic and stupid algorithms  and xdotool  :|
2016-09-02 14:13:21	pukahey	[14:10:22] nedbat: it's an ajax chat so idk how to do that.. now i'm making the GET with the headers i get from the Network tab but i got "{"redirect":"https:\/\/site.com\/forum\/chat\/","message":""}"
2016-09-02 14:13:21	ChrisWarrick	[14:10:33] damio: You sound like a newcomer. Please don’t use Python 3.6 if you are one.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	BlaXpirit	[14:10:33] damio, i don't think you should be that excited about python 3.6.  that said...   use pyenv
2016-09-02 14:13:21	nedbat	[14:11:03] ChrisWarrick, BlaXpirit: why not use 3.6, and why not be excited about it?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	ChrisWarrick	[14:11:04] Pennth: Don’t make functions that just make and return small things.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	ChrisWarrick	[14:11:17] nedbat: Has it been released yet?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	nedbat	[14:11:42] ChrisWarrick: no it hasn't, is that what you meant?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	pukahey	[14:11:45] nedbat: can you help?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	ChrisWarrick	[14:11:45] nedbat: A newcomer is better off sticking to released official versions instead of betas/whatever stage 3.6 is in now
2016-09-02 14:13:21	damio	[14:11:55] thanks BlaXpirit
2016-09-02 14:13:21	nedbat	[14:12:22] pukahey: i don't have much time to devote here right now, unfortunately
2016-09-02 14:13:21	pukahey	[14:12:34] ok..
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jeffreylevesque	[14:13:05] should every function have a docblock
2016-09-02 14:13:21	nedbat	[14:13:14] jeffreylevesque: a docstring, yes.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jeffreylevesque	[14:13:20] thank you

The way I see it is that it leaves the programmer-specified strings exactly as they would be in python 3, in 2. Without it you have a load of u' prefixes to strings which you'd then have to remove if you _stop_ supporting 2.

2016-09-02 18:23:59	Apteryx	_habnabit, tos9: I see this is already being challenging to run side by side versions, we already have to re-run the installer which pulls the fixed dependencies from a requirements.txt file. So I think you guys are right. Installing a package would be no different, and we're already not really running two versions of the same software side by side. Thanks for allowing me to see the light. ;)

2016-09-02 20:17:56	brizz	firefox has a nice 'Xpath selector' plugin where you can test, and it will show you elements too..just not sure of syntax.  normally start with something like this:
2016-09-02 20:17:57	brizz	/*[@class=*]//input
2016-09-02 20:17:58	_habnabit	brizz, but it does not match class="cls3"

2016-09-03 02:43:04	tremby	alden: That would presumably require me to get my hands dirty with multipart uploads once the files are over a given size. I was hoping to leave that up to the library.

2016-09-03 02:47:45	tremby	alden: Yeah, my current solution, that's accurate. I have another which tech2_ suggested yesterday which just gives the response.raw object which requests.get(url, stream=True) gives straight to boto2 upload. It works but it seems to want to pull the entire file into memory first, which is not going to fly for huge files.

2016-09-03 12:26:25	henbruas	[12:09:49] Sorry, total misread
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Akuli	[12:09:57] _habnabit, whats your point with talking about twisted then?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	_habnabit	[12:10:07] Akuli, twisted has an implementation of it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	simpson	[12:10:28] henbruas, Akuli: Monte has it as syntax: https://github.com/monte-language/typhon/blob/master/mast/lib/streams.mt#L323-L325
2016-09-03 12:26:25	simpson	[12:10:53] Here `extends` does *not* mean inheritance; it means composition: the `mapSink` object will delegate all unhandled messages to the `sink` object.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	_habnabit	[12:11:33] that's some syntax highlighting
2016-09-03 12:26:25	_habnabit	[12:11:55] haha 'mathematica'
2016-09-03 12:26:25	simpson	[12:11:59] _habnabit: Github thinks that it's Mathematica, and they didn't accept the PR last time to fix it.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	_habnabit	[12:12:08] jerks
2016-09-03 12:26:25	simpson	[12:12:17] I'm going to try again in a few months after there's more Monte code in the wild.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	henbruas	[12:12:36] simpson, hmm, what practical difference does that make?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	_habnabit	[12:12:48] it's real encapsulation
2016-09-03 12:26:25	simpson	[12:12:48] henbruas: There's no classes.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	_habnabit	[12:12:52] not the fake stuff java has
2016-09-03 12:26:25	simpson	[12:13:19] henbruas: So it makes *all* the difference. Rather than two objects declaring that their classes are intertwingled, this is a direct composition between two objects.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Akuli	[12:13:32] _habnabit, are you still saying that inheritance is not ok for avoiding repetitive code?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	_habnabit	[12:13:53] Akuli, i'm saying it's not the only solution
2016-09-03 12:26:25	simpson	[12:13:54] And yes, both classes have to consent to inheritance. In Java, there's even a keyword, `final`, for that.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Akuli	[12:14:06] _habnabit, at least you were saying its not ok
2016-09-03 12:26:25	simpson	[12:14:09] Akuli: And I'm saying that it's not even necessary for object-based languages.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Akuli	[12:14:12] <_habnabit> and that's why you don't use inheritance

2016-09-03 12:26:25	_habnabit	[12:16:41] Akuli, sure. and you can do that without inheritance

2016-09-03 14:57:36	tech2_	dunk: you still have the issue of reprocessing if the signal occurs after the commit and before acknowledge, but it should be a bit more resilient otherwise. Machine shutdown, power-loss, etc. etc. are still issues.

2016-09-03 14:59:26	runciter	dunk: in a C program, if you want to actually do something with a signal, you have to set a global sig_atomic_t variable, then go through *all* your code and find places where you can check it and do something different
2016-09-03 14:59:32	Akuli	simpson, but you can't bind something like 80 or 40

2016-09-03 18:39:19	movedx	Hey. So in Go, I can define a struct/type and unmarshal some YAML into that type using tags on the fields. With Python, I can obviously load the YAML file into a variable, but is there a library that can do what Go can do, and use classes I define to construct an internal objcet tree?
2016-09-03 18:40:02	movedx	Maybe I'm approaching the problem wrong.

2016-09-03 23:44:37	jfhbrook	what's the deal with bpython?
2016-09-03 23:45:01	Yiota	I use it for attr and method completion
2016-09-03 23:45:17	jfhbrook	tab complete seems pretty critical

2016-09-04 01:46:31	jfhbrook	I know I said I would go to bed but it seems like there are 3 possibilities
2016-09-04 01:47:24	deego	I have a directory /home/deego/python/ai3/ai3/ which has a __init__.py and a test.py. It's path of sys.path. Yet, if I try: from ai3 import test, it doesn't recognize ai3. OTOH, if I try import test, it does work.
2016-09-04 01:47:32	jfhbrook	(1) total disregard for meaning (2) meant playfully, nuts as in disagreement not as in 5150 (3) meant straight-faced as in literally crazy
2016-09-04 01:47:39	deego	shouldn't ai3 be the main module and test the submodule?
2016-09-04 01:47:44	jfhbrook	I think this is a case of (2)
2016-09-04 01:47:52	deego	it's part* of sys.path
2016-09-04 01:48:03	reith	is there a way to align multiple lines visually in vim for pep8? I want align arguments of function which spread over multiple lines without guessing how many tabs needed..
2016-09-04 01:48:09	_habnabit	krarkrrrc, consider then that it didn't come across as a joke, and try to be more careful in the future

2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:14:33] i have a class with an attribute of type list. how do i properly add an item to that list in a child class / use the parent's list when declaring the child?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:14:43] i'll happily take 'that's stupid' as an answer
2016-09-04 12:32:20	sorressean	[12:14:46] one more question, I'm looking at some old code I wrote. is there a point to declaring vars on a class itself like class foo(object): bar="32 as opposed to declaring it in a ctor?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:15:09] hop: Is this a class attribute or an instance attribute?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	sorressean	[12:15:14] trying to figure out if I was just being stupid or if I had a reason.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	veverak	[12:15:22] in ctor?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:15:24] KirkMcDonald: class attribute
2016-09-04 12:32:20	transhuman_	[12:15:25] my biggest problem is understanding how to pass the files to it and the dimensions of the wall I tried -x y w and filenames from console but it does nothing and neither does executing it
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:15:27] sorressean: That makes it an instance attribute.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	veverak	[12:15:28] ah, constructor
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:15:30] sorressean: Errr.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:15:33] sorressean: A class attribute.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:15:40] KirkMcDonald: it's a list of panels on a page model (wagtail)
2016-09-04 12:32:20	veverak	[12:15:42] sorressean: in constructor -> object attribute, after class -> class attribute
2016-09-04 12:32:20	veverak	[12:15:58] sorressean: if you know other OOP, class attribute is equivvalient to 'static'
2016-09-04 12:32:20	veverak	[12:16:00] :)
2016-09-04 12:32:20	sorressean	[12:16:09] hrm okay. thanks!
2016-09-04 12:32:20	sorressean	[12:16:26] so declaring them as class attributes is not what I want. figured as much.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	 *	veverak [12:17:14] tends to put consts there
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:17:38] KirkMcDonald: `spam = Parent.spam + [...]`, but i wondered whether there's something super()-like that would get rid of the coupling
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:17:44] *works
2016-09-04 12:32:20	transhuman_	[12:17:49] tech2  looks to me like its supposed to read random video files from the current directory ... no parameters being passed is that correct?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	tech2_	[12:17:56] transhuman_: https://paste.debian.net/807667/ - possibly something more like that?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	tech2_	[12:18:10] transhuman_: it's from the current dir and every sub-dir.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	transhuman_	[12:19:00] thanks for that and thanks for clarifying
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:19:01] hop: Not really. The difficulty is that while you are in the class body, the class does not yet exist, so there's nothing to check to see what the parent is. There's also no instance, so super() doesn't provide anything that referring to the parent literally doesn't give you.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	transhuman_	[12:19:28] I am not good enough a programmer to write my own code yet...but i added some to this (basic stuff)
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:20:01] KirkMcDonald: so far so understood, but should i do it like above? just because something works...
2016-09-04 12:32:20	tech2_	[12:20:12] transhuman_: more importantly, does it work?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:20:14] hop: Seems okay to me.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	meinteil	[12:20:45] Is it not possible to use bcrypt on Appengine? what do you use for password encryption then?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:20:56] KirkMcDonald: thanks
2016-09-04 12:32:20	micparke	[12:20:57] Oh, it actually won't let me name it the same thing because of naming conflicts
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:21:08] when this project is over, i'll try something with a metaclass
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:21:24] this is about adding translated fields to a model
2016-09-04 12:32:20	transhuman_	[12:21:33] not yet tech2 but I am working on it....i think its missing a few modules
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:21:51] hop: A metaclass could do a thing, but it adds enough abstraction that it may be an open question whether that's better.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:22:32] KirkMcDonald: there's so much magic in django (and thus wagtail) already... i don't think i can make it worse ;)
2016-09-04 12:32:20	tech2_	[12:23:06] transhuman_: is it _telling_ you it's missing modules?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	deniska	[12:23:06] KirkMcDonald: django may already use a metaclass for something, so you'll have to subclass a metaclass…
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:23:33] deniska: sounds about right
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:23:35] Oof, yeah, if this is Django, you get to have fun with playing nice with its own metaclasses.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	transhuman_	[12:23:43] tech2 NameError: name 'name' is not defined
2016-09-04 12:32:20	transhuman_	[12:23:54] make a class or something?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	KirkMcDonald	[12:23:57] hop: A class decorator may work equally well and be less of a pain.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	deniska	[12:24:32] iirc in python subclass should have either the same metaclass as a parent or a subclass of the metaclass
2016-09-04 12:32:20	tech2_	[12:24:50] transhuman_: oops, my mistake - https://paste.debian.net/807708/
2016-09-04 12:32:20	hop	[12:24:57] KirkMcDonald: interesting! didn't think of that
2016-09-04 12:32:21	tech2_	[12:25:39] transhuman_: you'll need to add import os as well to the top, sorry, I removed that without thinking.

2016-09-04 12:37:59	dunk	_habnabit: regarding my safe-shutdown issue from yesterday - it was suggested that I send commands to the process's STDIN, or perhaps listen on some port and use HTTP. The latter option introduces a lot more moving parts, and there's also the security angle to consider (I'll have to configure iptables; more moving parts) - so the other option seems better.
2016-09-04 12:37:59	dunk	But if I'm not in an interactive console then am I to send the command straight to the STDIN file descriptor for that process in the /proc tree?

2016-09-04 16:17:24	foo	papna / deniska / kosh - thank you guys, really appreciate it. I think what's throwing me is this syntax: char in str2 for char in '.?!' ... but, if I understand, this translates to "char in str2" and it iterates through '.?!' and runs each one. It's so compact and simple...
2016-09-04 16:18:14	kosh	foo, once you understand how the notation works it is really simple, until then it is very hard
2016-09-04 16:18:40	kosh	any( .... ) return True if any item in it is true and it stops on the first True item it finds

2016-09-04 16:21:07	nullie	"in" in different roles looks weird there
2016-09-04 16:21:12	foo	I'm using this code to extract sentences out of a paragraph: https://bpaste.net/show/b64211b6a36a - should I be concerned about an infinite loop here? eg. lines 29 and 30 break out. I tested this with some text, but I'm wondering if there is anything I'm missing that could cause an infinite loop and/or if I need to have this code automatically break if there are not changes on 3 iterations. I feel like that would be safe
2016-09-04 16:21:19	pytuger	quup: doesn't it tell python "If i is equal to the item?"  I'm gonna be honest, I've been stuck on this prog for 3 days

2016-09-04 16:22:00	Fanna	Hi, so I have this idea in my head that shorter code is "better". I am doing some practices on practicepython.org , how i decided to study was to write the code out quickly and then finding a shorter quicker way to do it, so I hope you guys can maybe look at my last written code and tell me if there is a shorter more efficient way to do it. https://paste.pound-python.org/show/g8NRszf6EETET8pAGtXC/
2016-09-04 16:22:09	pytuger	quup, do you at least see the method behind my madness?
2016-09-04 16:22:20	foo	eg. I could say, "if text doesn't change in 3 iterations, then break out" - this could be a good failsafe
2016-09-04 16:22:24	Donitzo	is there any way to publish a python program as a web application?

2016-09-04 16:22:36	quup	pytuger: yea, try with just    if i == item
2016-09-04 16:22:48	pytuger	quup, thank you. Trying now.
2016-09-04 16:23:11	jfhbrook	okay, I think I know what question I need to ask
2016-09-04 16:23:24	quup	pytuger: (also line 24 and line 28  will return form the function, aborting the loop, but I assume that's just htere for debugging)
2016-09-04 16:23:29	jfhbrook	in python3, the sqlite driver recognizes a memoryview object as a bytes/buffer-like thing
2016-09-04 16:23:46	jfhbrook	but in python2 it confuses the driver, which seems to expect a buffer object or perhaps a bytes object
2016-09-04 16:23:54	jfhbrook	any protips for typecasting that properly?

2016-09-04 20:20:09	daftbun	yeah sure
2016-09-04 20:20:18	daftbun	so one is version of python is the default 2.7.11

2016-09-05 21:58:39	axujen	[21:32:00] alden, it tells programs where to look for things
2016-09-05 21:58:39	axujen	[21:32:16] in my case its looking for the precompiled libarchive libraries
2016-09-05 21:58:39	axujen	[21:32:24] deniska, yeah but it has to be ignored globally

2016-09-05 21:58:39	axujen	[21:32:35] but i guess you're right thats a better way to do it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	axujen	[21:32:54] alden, it needs to load the libarchive dlls through ctype.CDLL()

2016-09-05 21:58:39	tamarin	[21:48:28] CodFection, Python has a REPL (read-eval-print) so if you're not interesting in a book then go grab Python, start it, and start mashing away. ;)

2016-09-06 11:21:09	Schrostfutz	[10:47:45] _habnabit: This is the problem illustrated: http://sprunge.us/OcWT
2016-09-06 11:21:09	_habnabit	[10:48:25] Schrostfutz, then it can't find the module
2016-09-06 11:21:09	_habnabit	[10:48:38] Schrostfutz, you're missing protocol/__init__.py
2016-09-06 11:21:09	hiya	[10:49:29] bjs, and then if it finds it to be true it says "Logged in" and if false then "hacking is bad"
2016-09-06 11:21:09	vbgunz_	[10:49:55] bjs: thanks for the advice, I am currently using PyCharm and I'm not figuring it out here
2016-09-06 11:21:09	hiya	[10:49:55] it is just test stuff, in reality i need it to exit 0 for true and 1 for false
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Schrostfutz	[10:50:40] _habnabit: I created an empty __init__.py but that did not resolve the problem. The files are there: http://sprunge.us/LeLh, also, when I just import "protocol_pb2" it fails with python2 only because of its dependency, protocol.session_pb2...
2016-09-06 11:21:09	_habnabit	[10:51:09] Schrostfutz, your directory structure and imports are very strange
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Schrostfutz	[10:52:13] _habnabit: What would you change, normally I'd want to have plain protocol, protocol.session, protocol.network.cam modules but with the generated code I found no way of doing just that
2016-09-06 11:21:09	_habnabit	[10:53:10] Schrostfutz, you mean, because it's always _pb2.py ?
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Schrostfutz	[10:53:48] _habnabit: yes
2016-09-06 11:21:09	_habnabit	[10:54:28] Schrostfutz, the strange part is that you're setting PYTHONPATH and doing implicit relative imports, and you have no __init__.py files in this tree at all
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Schrostfutz	[10:55:27] _habnabit: I'm doing relative imports because I want to keep the protocol code separate from the code that tests it. I will probably need to separate it into multiple projects in the future, anyway
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Pizzarabe	[10:57:26] guys, i guess i have to bother you again. I am trying to use the payload direct in the post request but i can not get the syntax correct.
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Pizzarabe	[10:57:42] payload = {"provisioning_template": {'"template": "Template created by create_hook","name":'+ template_name + ',locked: "false"'}}
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Pizzarabe	[10:57:43] post = requests.post(foreman_host + '/api/provisioning_templates', auth=(apiuser,apiuser_pass), data=json.dumps(payload), json={'headers': {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}})
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Schrostfutz	[10:58:07] _habnabit: tbh I did not know about the necessity for __init__.pys
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Pizzarabe	[10:58:44] the output of payload is a little bit strange too "{'provisioning_template': set(['"template": "Template created by create_hook","name":cert_snippet_alien1.rz.tu-bs.de,locked: "false"'])}"
2016-09-06 11:21:09	CrtxReavr	[10:59:34] Pizzarabe, stop trying to use strings that look like json.
2016-09-06 11:21:09	CrtxReavr	[11:00:20] YOu can build a dict of dicts and data=json.dumps(payload) will handle it just fine.

2016-09-06 14:03:23	Wooble	[13:56:29] afx_: if you want relative to the current module, something like os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'relative/path)
2016-09-06 14:03:23	hop	[13:56:30] afx_: you never told us, relative to what
2016-09-06 14:03:23	deadmarshal	[13:56:32] :)
2016-09-06 14:03:23	L1M4R	[13:56:34] im writing a shell, like a computer
2016-09-06 14:03:23	afx_	[13:56:39] Wooble: I have two packages one : bin and one lib . I run a script from bin that wants to connect to a sqlite3 .db file from lib dir
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Pici	[13:56:39] L1M4R: What do you plan to do once you find what you're looking for?
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Knyght	[13:56:49] Jason_: yes
2016-09-06 14:03:23	L1M4R	[13:56:51] pici say that im logged in
2016-09-06 14:03:23	L1M4R	[13:57:14] wait im pasting th ecode
2016-09-06 14:03:23	nmuntz	[13:57:18] whats wrong with this statement? cur.execute('SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM ? WHERE job_url = ?)', (table_name, job_url)) i keep getting syntax error
2016-09-06 14:03:23	yoha	[13:57:27] L1M4R: you can just read the file into a string, then search the string. The short version: open("file.txt").read().find("alice")
2016-09-06 14:03:23	KirkMcDonald	[13:57:36] nmuntz: You're trying to parameterize a table name.
2016-09-06 14:03:23	L1M4R	[13:57:44] okay thanks
2016-09-06 14:03:23	L1M4R	[13:57:48] yoha thanks
2016-09-06 14:03:23	KirkMcDonald	[13:57:49] nmuntz: You can only parameterize values.
2016-09-06 14:03:23	deadmarshal	[13:57:59] how can i search the db field from Entry widget in tkinter?
2016-09-06 14:03:23	yoha	[13:58:00] L1M4R: no problem
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Wooble	[13:58:10] nmuntz: sqlalchemy is nice if you need to dynamically choose tables.
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Wooble	[13:58:19] nmuntz: (also if you don't...)
2016-09-06 14:03:23	nmuntz	[13:58:21] KirkMcDonald, ahhh! so whats the correct way to parametrize a table name? using format perhaps?
2016-09-06 14:03:23	KirkMcDonald	[13:58:55] nmuntz: Format the string, though use caution when doing so. Or a tool like sqlalchemy's query builder can do this somewhat sensibly.
2016-09-06 14:03:23	L1M4R	[13:59:19] https://bpaste.net/show/f1de903b3f4b yoha here
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Wooble	[13:59:23] (using string formatting works... but opens you up to all the dangers you're using parameterization to avoid)
2016-09-06 14:03:23	KirkMcDonald	[13:59:35] nmuntz: Or, ideally, refactor your schema so that you don't need to do so in the first place.
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Jason_	[13:59:54] Knyght: dang
2016-09-06 14:03:23	afx_	[14:00:18] Wooble: sqlite3.connect(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'lib/db.db') this does not work . Please forgive my ignorance !
2016-09-06 14:03:23	afx_	[14:01:11] for importing a module this works: from lib import module1
2016-09-06 14:03:23	L1M4R	[14:01:16] yoha can we write in private its better to read your text there, here is so much text
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Pici	[14:01:43] L1M4R: if username and password in line   is equivalent to   if (username) and (password in line)  .  It does not check to see whether both strings are in your line.
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Wooble	[14:02:27] afx_: you may need a '../' in there if you're running from /bin and the file is in /lib at the same level?
2016-09-06 14:03:23	nmuntz	[14:02:46] KirkMcDonald, excellent! thank you!

2016-09-06 15:21:39	b52	is it possible to define the allocation behavior, e.g., deallocate objects with no more strong reference only when the host system has no more memory available? im trying to achieve something like a cache, that drops elements when memory is short and re-computes when needed

2016-09-06 19:35:19	ninjaaron	 So, I'm working on this thing that lets you use python as a filter in the shell kind of like perl and awk. https://github.com/ninjaaron/pyfil. Presently, if an object is a builtin collection type, it attempts to serialize it as json before printing it. Should this json be indented, or just a single line?

2016-09-06 19:42:37	ninjaaron	The other thing it does, is if the expression evaluates to an iterator, it will serialize each collection object as json, so I'm thinking one line for printing the multiple objects, and indent as the default for single objects.

2016-09-06 20:43:27	ninjaaron	[19:35:19]  So, I'm working on this thing that lets you use python as a filter in the shell kind of like perl and awk. https://github.com/ninjaaron/pyfil. Presently, if an object is a builtin collection type, it attempts to serialize it as json before printing it. Should this json be indented, or just a single line?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	ninjaaron	[19:36:31] (it does a single line right now)
2016-09-06 20:43:27	_habnabit	[19:39:48] ninjaaron, imo default to indented and have a flag for single-line
2016-09-06 20:43:27	ninjaaron	[19:40:45] _habnabit: ok.
2016-09-06 20:43:27	ninjaaron	[19:42:37] The other thing it does, is if the expression evaluates to an iterator, it will serialize each collection object as json, so I'm thinking one line for printing the multiple objects, and indent as the default for single objects.
2016-09-06 20:43:27	ninjaaron	[19:45:26] (each collection object the iterator returns, assuming it returns collection objects)
2016-09-06 20:43:27	d3vyL	[19:45:52] Hello guys, can someone help me about match this 2 lists? I'm trying to see difflib.SequenceMatcher but I don't know if I'm doing correctly,    https://bpaste.net/show/a98aa3abe136
2016-09-06 20:43:27	d3vyL	[19:46:21] I would like to match for item in list_league the correct or (similar) match for list_href
2016-09-06 20:43:27	climjark	[19:47:39] hello all!
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:48:38] If im doing datetime.date.fromtimestamp and getting a different date than someone else its probably to do with locale right?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	_habnabit	[19:49:22] elb0w, fromtimestamp gives you a naieve datetime in the local timezone
2016-09-06 20:43:27	_habnabit	[19:49:58] elb0w, better to use arrow if you can
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:54:19] _habnabit: ok, if I dont do you know of any alternatives?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	_habnabit	[19:54:34] elb0w, if you don't what?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:54:48] _habnabit: where I work takes a few weeks to add a new lib
2016-09-06 20:43:27	_habnabit	[19:55:04] elb0w, i'm so sorry
2016-09-06 20:43:27	jfhbrook	[19:55:25] elb0w: out of curiosity, why?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:55:41] haha
2016-09-06 20:43:27	d3vyL	[19:55:43] any ideas? :(
2016-09-06 20:43:27	jfhbrook	[19:55:44] elb0w: like everywhere I've worked you just included the dep in your manifest when submitting to code review and
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:55:46] its a bank
2016-09-06 20:43:27	jfhbrook	[19:55:51] oh cripes
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:55:54] it has to get approved

2016-09-06 20:43:27	jfhbrook	[19:55:59] I could never work in finance
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:56:03] then it has to go through testing/ stable/ release
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:56:13] yeah its a pita
2016-09-06 20:43:27	jfhbrook	[19:56:22] I like my delivery like I do my integration

2016-09-06 20:43:27	jfhbrook	[19:56:47] I'd drink one for you but my cupboards are bare
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:57:30] yeah and ofc arrow isnt available :P
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:57:34] :)
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[19:59:59] _habnabit: ah just used datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(ts)
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[20:00:00] did the trick
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elb0w	[20:00:10] thanks for the help
2016-09-06 20:43:27	_habnabit	[20:00:17] elb0w, it'll still be naieve, but it'll be in utc

2016-09-07 00:35:23	deego	And, although the manual makes you think 3.4 is everything done better, it seems that outside of the official circles, some people beg to differ..
2016-09-07 00:35:37	yvear	wleslie, actually, if the functions were instead a method of a class, could the master task (with lock) commit and then .add again not with querying, but with each class' object?

2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[01:55:20] _habnabit:  correct and thanks
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[01:55:30] paul1337, i don't know of any offhand
2016-09-07 02:15:21	paul1337	[01:56:10] can i execute and rum code on emac same time?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	paul1337	[01:56:14] as idle does.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[01:56:37] paul1337, sure
2016-09-07 02:15:21	paul1337	[01:57:30] i have heard emacs have many other functions like email and others can you point out main and necessary functions?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[01:57:59] finally got a working TCP socket server (threaded)
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[01:58:06] paul1337, this is more #emacs conversation now
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[01:58:13] no examples out there are any good
2016-09-07 02:15:21	paul1337	[01:58:19] Oh yea sorry :)
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[01:58:24] sacrebleu, that's because threaded IO isn't very good
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[01:59:01] no its because people have no idea what 'timeout' and 'select' really mean until they dig deep
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[01:59:16] sacrebleu, select? that doesn't sound like threaded IO
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[01:59:31] its threaded in that the main thread is not the networking thread
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[01:59:52] sacrebleu, oh, so you made your own version of crochet for twisted?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:00:02] i didn't want to use twisted its bloaty
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:00:05] but it looks nice
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[02:00:14] sacrebleu, 'bloaty'?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:00:34] well, my server code is probably 150 lines (minus command interpreter)
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:00:52] theirs comes with everything else 1000s of lines bleah bleah
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:01:27] and mine does what i need it to, but i did like it and would have gone to twisted if i didn't get this working.  i actually do have one last problem and that has to do with the socket cleanup but whatever, tomorrow is another day
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[02:02:01] sacrebleu, well, yeah, you need thousands of lines because networking is complex
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:02:17] its actually because libraries are written to generically solve every problem
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:02:23] look at Boost for instance
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[02:02:24] sacrebleu, did you know that python itself is thousands of lines?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:02:43] python is a binary written in something like cpp c++ bison flex or something
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:02:59] what's your point, 1000s of lines = slower CPU
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:03:14] if i can solve it with a 150 line solution, that's fine by me
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:03:35] maybe in some other context that wouldn't make sense, but this one fits the bill
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[02:03:46] sacrebleu, i'm not sure how that follows, but i can pretty much guarantee that those 150 lines don't solve every problem that twisted solves. networking is very fiddly and it's easy to make something that looks like it's ok but isn't
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:04:13] of course it doesn't solve every problem twisted solves, that's the point, i dont need 98% of what twisted is solving
2016-09-07 02:15:21	reith	[02:04:18] is there a format directive to print list elements using __str__ rather __repr__ on list?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[02:04:22] reith, no
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:04:28] it solves my problem, is my point, without relying on another's lib
2016-09-07 02:15:21	reith	[02:04:36] _habnabit: fast response, thanks :D
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[02:04:50] sacrebleu, no, i'm talking about critical parts of writing networking code, like handling EINTR, EAGAIN, etc.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:05:11] meh
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[02:05:18] sacrebleu, 'meh'?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	sacrebleu	[02:05:25] yeah effin meh goodnight
2016-09-07 02:15:21	_habnabit	[02:05:38] ok then

2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:04:55] Yhg1s: '2339'
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:05:02] because it's  a string ?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:05:42] ramsub07: that would be rather surprising, as % would be an error on that string. How are you printing the repr
2016-09-07 09:43:19	merijn	[09:05:47] hmmm, how do I troubleshoot a package being available in the regular python interpreter, but not in ipython?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:05:55] merijn: print sys.prefix.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:06:10] Yhg1s: from pdb console
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:06:28] ramsub07: okay, what is the actual thing you enter in pdb, and what is the actual output you get?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:06:50] (Pdb) repr((max_width - len(comp_window[f_count]))) '2339'
2016-09-07 09:43:19	merijn	[09:06:58] Yhg1s: Right, that seems to be the culprit...time to start kicking the package manager :\
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:07:28] merijn: why do you think kicking is necessary?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:07:50] ramsub07: okay, in pdb, 'p' will already print the repr, so you can just do 'p (max_width - len(comp_window[f_count]))'
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:08:24] ramsub07: so it is an integer, and the true branch should not be taken. What makes you think the true branch is taken?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	merijn	[09:08:29] Yhg1s: ipython is using /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7 (macports folder) python is using /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7, so somehow macports has decided it should *not* be using my system python install
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:08:43] Yhg1s: i don't understand ?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:08:48] merijn: yes, of course. it would be using the macports python.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:08:57] ramsub07: I'm not sure what the confusion is, sorry.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	v4ult	[09:09:56] When creating unit tests for a flask app, where do you normally put the test package? I am either receiving an import error where it cant find find the main app package or I receive a value error if I put the test package inside the main app.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	merijn	[09:09:56] Yhg1s: The packages it's not finding (numpy) are also installed using macports, yet somehow that is installed for the system python, rather than macports python
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:10:00] Yhg1s: what do you mean by true branch?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	merijn	[09:10:35] Yhg1s: So it's not obvious to me that it works in one, but not the other
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:10:41] ramsub07: 'if statement introduces branches in the code. One block of code, the 'if' block, is the 'true' branch, and the other (optional) block of code, the 'else' block, is the 'false' branch.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:10:56] Yhg1s: ah!
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:10:58] merijn: that is odd, yes.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:11:11] v4ult: what is this 'value error'?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:11:19] Yhg1s: i had set a PDB breakpoint at the true one when it isn't actually an even number
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:12:00] Yhg1s: later in the code, i do a multiplication, if you see... there i got a dimension mismatch error. Using which i set a breakpoint

2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:12:18] v4ult: then you're importing it as a top-level module, but it's tryign to do explicit relative imports.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	merijn	[09:12:23] Yhg1s: Hence said kicking of the package manager :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:12:30] v4ult: or running it directly. How are you running the tests?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	v4ult	[09:13:23] I am calling the test file directly from the terminal. I haven't written any tests yet. Just imports
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:13:52] v4ult: okay: don't run tests that way. You can't use relative imports that way, because the test is a top-level module. Python won't know you intend for it to be in a package.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:14:17] v4ult: use a test runner to run the test instead, from the directory containing the top-level package, like python -m unittest discover, or py.test.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:14:26] v4ult: you may want to visit bit.ly/pypackages
2016-09-07 09:43:19	jayjo	[09:15:57] I have a program that I wrote that accepts a parameter and returns an object. I want to loop through many parameters and return many objects, labeled by the parameter. What's the best way to do something like this? If the parameter is an integer, should I convert it to a string and use that string as a key in a dictionary and keep the object as the value?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:16:23] jayjo: why convert it to a string? You can use integers as dict keys.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	jayjo	[09:16:31] Yhg1s: interesting.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	v4ult	[09:16:39] Yhg1s: Thanks I will have a read
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:16:41] jayjo: I'm not sure how what you describe isn't just a direct dict lookup.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ramsub07	[09:16:48] Yhg1s: could you help me why i get into the true branch ?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:17:11] ramsub07: I can't tell that you are, so I can only suggest what nedbat likes to describe as "when in doubt, print more out".
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Yhg1s	[09:17:28] ramsub07: print the value of max_width - comp_width[f_count] *in the true branch*.

2016-09-07 17:22:11	_habnabit	[17:14:46] Articate, what's a word
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:14:49] int(line.split()[0])?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	_habnabit	[17:15:25] Articate, is '-1 a' starting with a number? '1.0 a'? '-1.0 a'? '-1e10'? '-1e'?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:15:38] Eh, either way, just do with open(file) as f: \n for line in file: \n if line[0].isdigit(): -- do stuff

2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:16:55] _habnabit: anything is fine, really, so long as it's fast. I know the numbers will be 2-4 digits long, and won't be negative or like 1e10, but I check for that later, I just want to discard as many lines as possible for now

2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:17:16] Articate, wow, that's tougher
2016-09-07 17:22:11	_habnabit	[17:17:27] Articate, i've been asking you repeatedly what you consider a number
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:17:29] what I'm saying is I don't mind
2016-09-07 17:22:11	_habnabit	[17:17:37] Articate, what don't you mind
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:17:49] If you don't mind missing numbers, then no problem
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:17:57] But if 1e10 is a possibility, that's a problem
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:18:02] I don't mind taking more than what should be considered a number
2016-09-07 17:22:11	_habnabit	[17:18:09] Articate, okay, here you go: True
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:18:14] Haha
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:18:33] Well, you're going to need regex
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:18:47] _habnabit: I didn't know if you had some way to include those forms in a way that would be generic, which is why I said I wouldn't mind
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:19:13] Articate, try this
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:19:17] /[+\-]?(?:0|[1-9]\d*)(?:\.\d*)?(?:[eE][+\-]?\d+)?/
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:19:27] So, to specify it more to what you were saying, AMorpork, I know all numbers will be 2-4 digits long
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:19:35] Oh, that helps a lot
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:19:36] 1-4 digits
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:19:42] and will be at the start of the line
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:19:56] if they're not, I'm happy to discard that line
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:20:01] Will all lines be at least 4 digits long?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:20:05] 4 characters*
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:20:16] I think it's safe to say they'll be at least 15 characters long
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:20:23] and I'm happy to discard those that aren't
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:20:23] Ok, that's good
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:20:32] This doesn't happen to be a CSV, does it?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:20:38] nope
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:20:45] just a file we manually keep
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:20:54] Can you happen to give me a few lines so I can try a regex?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:20:54] so it's not elegant
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:21:12] hold on a sec
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:21:13] I'm bored af right now so it seems like a good use of my time
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:21:32] I really was just thinking something simple :p
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:21:45] But basically, you'll just want to read line by line, match line[:4], and run a regex on it
2016-09-07 17:22:11	AMorpork	[17:21:50] It'll still be simple
2016-09-07 17:22:11	Articate	[17:21:51] I'm reading the entire file and just matching against every line at this point. I just figured I'd throw out the lines that I could

2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[20:52:12] I'm just trying to understand what matters; when people switch from braces to significant whitespace and vice versa.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[20:53:23] the better I understand people's intentions/reasons, the better I can make my configuration langauge for them.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	derek_v	[20:53:40] nhooyr: one advantage of the significant whitespace strategy is that the structure is being described one way instead of two ways
2016-09-07 21:02:38	BigRonnieRon	[20:54:04] I prefer braces on longer system/level projects. I think most people do, hence Go's brackets
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[20:55:05] BigRonnieRon: at the end of section 4 it's explained: https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article (I was linked to it by rob pike himself)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	BigRonnieRon	[20:55:06] On something like a scripting language though, it seems silly and unnecessary
2016-09-07 21:02:38	derek_v	[20:55:07] curly brace code still gets indentation that can potentially contradict what the braces describe
2016-09-07 21:02:38	thunderbolt	[20:56:31] Clearly the solution is both delimiters and indentation must line up for the program to compile ;-)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[20:56:35] derek_v: that is why gofmt automatically fixes everything!
2016-09-07 21:02:38	thunderbolt	[20:56:36] python with end statements.

2016-09-07 21:02:38	nedbat	[20:57:26] BigRonnieRon: there are plenty of large python projects with no braces.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[20:58:13] has anyone used YAML? Do you find it a pain to write, but beautiful to read?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	wyoung	[20:58:35] nhooyr: I have used it, although I prefer json (used to it)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[20:58:54] wyoung: what specifically drives you away from YAML?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nedbat	[20:59:00] nhooyr: i prefer yaml to json :)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	deniska	[20:59:19] nhooyr: I use yaml as a config format with less punctuation
2016-09-07 21:02:38	BigRonnieRon	[20:59:23] nyooyr: Yep, I agree p much completely with what he wrote there. Of course, I like C a lot. And Go is basically a modern C on steroids w/actual network capabilities.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	wyoung	[20:59:24] nhooyr: the fact that I haven't used it that much :)  it isn't a drive, I just haven't been exposed to it that much
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nedbat	[20:59:38] nhooyr: yaml has comments
2016-09-07 21:02:38	deniska	[20:59:46] BigRonnieRon: go is a simplified java
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[20:59:50] nedbat: what if json had comments?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[20:59:58] deniska: it was intently designed after C, not java
2016-09-07 21:02:38	thunderbolt	[21:00:04] yaml > json

2016-09-07 21:02:38	wyoung	[21:00:15] nhooyr: people like to minify it any way so there wouldn't be much point of comments
2016-09-07 21:02:38	BigRonnieRon	[21:00:18] It's nothing like java.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	deniska	[21:00:19] nhooyr: and yet it feels more like java to me than c

2016-09-07 21:02:38	thunderbolt	[21:00:39] I wish YAML was easier to parse.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	wyoung	[21:00:48] thunderbolt: it is with libraries
2016-09-07 21:02:38	deniska	[21:00:50] BigRonnieRon: C has neither gc nor interfaces, java has :)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	BigRonnieRon	[21:00:55] IDK that much about it tbh, I just started working on my blog in Hugo.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[21:00:59] that was unintentional but has been recognized by the go authors IIRC. People didn't leave C for Go, they left Java/Python/Ruby for Go.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	wyoung	[21:01:00] deniska: C++ then?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	thunderbolt	[21:01:42] wyoung: I basically mean that I wish it was parsable by a CFG with a indentation hack like Python is. Specifically.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	thunderbolt	[21:01:57] wyoung: Or that there was a YAML lib in the stdlib. That would also make me happy :-)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	deniska	[21:02:03] wyoung: C++ is a complicated C, Java is a simplified C++, golang is a simplified java. But that's offtopic :)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	nhooyr	[21:02:06] nedbat: that's interesting, I'm actually surprised that only comments in json is all you need. What do you think of a format like https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl
2016-09-07 21:02:38	wyoung	[21:02:16] deniska: what is scala then?

2016-09-07 21:14:02	thunderbolt	nhooyr: Yeah. Python style indentation requires a stack in the tokenizer. It's simple, but not as simple as braces.

2016-09-07 21:14:37	thunderbolt	nhooyr: It's basically a sequence of two CFG parsers, one that tokenizes and then one that parses the token stream. I think it's worth the complexity, because I think indentation aids in readability/usability.

2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:23:41] It's not Unicode then
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:24:24] If it doesn't satisfy Unicode properties, such as can be encoded with UTF-8, then it's not Unicode
2016-09-08 10:38:49	FeersumEndjinn	[10:26:29] Hi - I'm written most of an API wrapper (API isn't quite finished) and I wanted to test it within a larger project.  However, when I drop the project directory and subdirs into my larger project, Python suddenly cannot find the subdirs?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:26:35] Remram[m]: Which str cannot be encoded with UTF-8?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:27:10] tos9: anything with surrogate escapes for undecodeable bytes.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ELFrederich	[10:27:24] Maybe it is just that a lot of these "projects" install just a single "package" of the same exact name, so we end up calling that project a package when it's really a project.  We need a PEP for this
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ELFrederich	[10:27:28] ;-)
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:27:31] Remram[m]: practicality beats purity.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	FeersumEndjinn	[10:28:07] However when I run the test code within the wrapper everything works fine.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	FeersumEndjinn	[10:28:27] For note, each of the subdirs includes __init__.py
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:28:38] FeersumEndjinn: it's hard to say what's wrong without seeing the file layout and what you're running how. Have you read bit.ly/pypackages?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:28:42] tos9: try 'r\udce9mi'.encode('utf-8')
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:28:48] Oh. Is that how that ended up working out. That's kind of unfortunate.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:29:15] That kind of hurts when a big reason for the compatibility break was unicode support
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:29:31] and you end up with something that feels inferior
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:29:42] Python 2 had proper unicode support
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:29:56] Remram[m]: unfortunately the real world contains too many arbitrary bytes.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	meejah	[10:29:59] 6
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:30:20] Yhg1s: I mean -- do you think that decision would have been made if everyone knew bytes was gonna be un-crippled 5 years later anyhow
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:30:22] That's why Python's use of bytes to represent bytes seems like such a good option
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:30:30] Someone probably would have said "OK fine leave some more stuff as bytes then"
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:30:35] tos9: I'm not sure what you mean, sorry.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:30:36] trying to pretend like everything is unicode is not "unicode support"
2016-09-08 10:38:49	kblin	[10:30:42] Remram[m]: partly. not all of stdlib, though
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:31:02] Yes, some of stdlib needed fixing. Which didn't need a change in the language at all
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:31:15] Yhg1s: Most of the things that probably caused this change are things that really truly are bytes but were forced into text because that was the only capable text type at the time, yes?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:31:19] the only reason no one will fix it now is because the core team wants us to switch to Python 3
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:31:23] tos9: no.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:31:36] tos9: the things that caused this change are things *people* consider 'text' but the *system* consider bytes.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:31:45] considers, even.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:31:57] I mean I consider CLI args and filenames-on-appropriate-platforms to be bytes :P
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:32:02] I should meet some of these people I guess.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:32:04] Remram[m]: please do not ascribe motivation to people. A lot of people simply do not agree with your point of view.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:32:19] obviously
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:32:24] they made Python 3
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:32:30] Yhg1s: I guess in some places like files you can't really win.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:32:49] Since some fs'es consider them to be text and some don't, so you would have probably needed this regardless?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:33:01] tos9: fun fact, they are not; these are Unicode on Windows
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:33:04] tos9: if you mean filenames, yes.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:33:16] Yhg1s: Filenames, yeah.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:33:22] Remram[m]: that's tos9's point.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:33:32] Remram[m]: they're text on some systems, and bytes on others.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Remram[m]	[10:33:37] and not even proper unicode, Windows's UTF-16 implementation is broken, leaving argv not proper unicode either
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:34:34] Maybe in the next decent language paths won't be strings, and we can be further away from this problem :/
2016-09-08 10:38:49	FeersumEndjinn	[10:34:42] Yhg1s I think it's going to be cleaner to write a setup.py for the wrapper so that it can be installed properly.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:35:05] tos9: you stil have to take them as arguments, or read them from directories, and mix them with *some* form of string to generate or manipulate them.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Yhg1s	[10:37:28] tos9: so you have to deal with encodings and representations one way or another.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	tos9	[10:37:42] Yhg1s: My brain isn't working well yet, still catching up -- but like --

2016-09-08 10:40:30	tech2_	Remram[m]: file a bug re: surrogates. Otherwise, do you need help with something or are you just here to rant?   The separation was regarding "a sequence of codepoints" vs. "a sequence of bytes" for the most part that works, you'd probably be in an awkward place if something was generating lone surrogates.
2016-09-08 10:40:34	crem	The only thing which annoys me in python's unicode is when app print()s unicode strings, and my terminal is non-unicode, it crashes.  There's no way to say something like "show everything unencodeable as ?" without modifying all print()s, is there?

2016-09-08 16:12:36	disi	[16:05:06] elosz: well, if you're hitting the return on line 30, then there is a case that doesnt hit any of those

2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:05:41] cq1: Good ctypes idiom is "don't use ctypes" :)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	cq1	[16:06:00] tos9: What's wrong with ctypes?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:06:08] cq1: It's obsolete.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:06:15] cq1: CFFI is the thing to use for interfacing with C.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	JackofSpades707	[16:06:57] pypy or Cython might be useful for you as well
2016-09-08 16:12:36	disi	[16:07:10] elosz: you probably could/should simplify your loops
2016-09-08 16:12:36	v1r0	[16:07:10] dumb question, why does this print None. https://paste.pound-python.org/show/V66obsnPFBQLtqRfeLr4/

2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:08:06] cq1: What disadvantage is there in adding a dependency?

2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:08:38] cq1: (There are no plans to remove ctypes, and unfortunately it really can't be removed sanely.)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	pv2b	[16:08:56] elosz: i like your algorithm because it's the exact same one I came up with when i wrote a sudoku solver myself a few years ago :)

2016-09-08 16:12:36	_habnabit	[16:09:06] JackofSpades707, pypy doesn't have a non-cffi FFI, and cython is really only necessary for C++
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:09:06] ssbr: I knew someone would say that :)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ssbr	[16:09:09] tos9: remove ctypes and make it a third-party package.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:09:18] ssbr: That was a practical sentence, not a hypothetical one.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ssbr	[16:09:19] tos9: like, realistically, this doesn't break code -- you can always just add a dependency.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elosz	[16:09:22] pv2b: I did even better one, using constraint propogation. That was super fast
2016-09-08 16:12:36	JackofSpades707	[16:09:23] _habnabit: Good to know, thanks
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ssbr	[16:09:30] I don't understand what's impractical about removing stdlib libraries from the stdlib.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:09:36] ssbr: Right, that's not going to happen (in the sense of "it's not a thing that CPython ahs ever done")
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elosz	[16:09:40] pv2b: and incase you haven't read it, read this : http://norvig.com/sudoku.html
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ssbr	[16:09:49] tos9: they came close with asyncore
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:09:52] ssbr: And even though Guido keeps saying things like he wants to shrink the stdlib, there hasn't been any progress there.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	pv2b	[16:09:53] elosz: I didn't like how your recursive call to solve() starts over at i,j = 0,0 rather than just indexing into the matrix at the last known good coordinate, but i tried it and it doesn't make much difference
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ssbr	[16:09:55] maybe they'll come close again, given asyncio.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:10:09] ssbr: When they remove a single library, I'll be a bit more careful with the sentence then :)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ssbr	[16:10:17] :(
2016-09-08 16:12:36	_habnabit	[16:10:21] heh heh
2016-09-08 16:12:36	_habnabit	[16:10:28] yes i'll believe it when i see it
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:10:36] I would *love* to see it.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	_habnabit	[16:10:43] considering the extremely low bar that the 'maintainers' of asyncore tripped over
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:11:07] TBH if any hiccups happen and PyPy3 can't be as fast as PyPy2, and no one creates a better language than Python in the next 5 years...
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:11:15] Both of which would cause me to sstill be using PyPy2 in 5 years
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:11:39] I'd probably start to look into joining a team to fork py27 myself, and hey, then could remove whatever I wanted.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tos9	[16:11:51] (I doubt that will happen though, hopefully pypy3 can be good.)

2016-09-08 17:56:35	Drisc0	I have a quick question about sorting. I have a json object thats a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has the same keys. If I need to sort the list for multiple different keys, whats the best way to do this? I care more about time complexity than space complexity. I know list.sort() does in place sorting while sorted() does copying. Is it faster to keep sorting the same object with list.sort() for each key, or should I sort
2016-09-08 17:56:35	Drisc0	the original with sorted()?

Because when I do load_source, I need the functions within the loaded python module; however, it seems that the import statements at the top of the module are also included as attributes. I need to not import those or somehow know they are imports. Anyone?

2016-09-08 20:55:06	SmartAsianGuy	the professor said that it's because 0.1 is converted to 2 base system and then converted back to the decimal system but why isn't it happening to my Python 3?
2016-09-08 20:55:51	jfhbrook	could he be using python 2?

2016-09-08 20:56:47	SmartAsianGuy	jfhbook: yes he's using python 2 but 'computers' use the binary system so it should happen to my python as well. right?
2016-09-08 20:56:47	jfhbrook	I don't know for sure, just a suggestion, but the professor is right that that *sort* of thing is because of floating point error yeah

2016-09-09 09:48:10	rockworldmi	[09:09:36] i am want to create python script which can generate frequency sound from random text  file.. what is good way to go about it?  http://pastebin.com/bxpRHbh3

2016-09-09 09:48:10	Yhg1s	[09:10:17] BytesAndCoffee: no, really, don't use a list as a parameter default. Just use None, then check for None before using it.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	rockworldmi	[09:10:47] generating int using ord('char') for each character is the way to do?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Yhg1s	[09:11:37] rockworldmi: it vaguely sounds like you want to use a bytearray instead, but it's a little hard to tell.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Siecje	[09:11:37] t-ask: Just make a new virtualenv `virtualenv venv` then `source venv/bin/activate` then install the package
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Wooble	[09:12:17] (possibly with virtualenv -p python2  just to be sure)
2016-09-09 09:48:10	rockworldmi	[09:12:23] Yhg1s, hmm..
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Wooble	[09:14:12] t-ask: you might try installing pdfminer.six in py3 first, and see if that's the only py2-only dependency...
2016-09-09 09:48:10	rockworldmi	[09:16:00] Yhg1s, so idea is to create bytearray using open file? then pass on each array elements to frequency using loop.

2016-09-09 09:48:10	liste	[09:18:39] crem: the examples in dbm docs seem to be using both bytes and strings
2016-09-09 09:48:10	crem	[09:19:41] yes, examples of dbm do, but examples of shelve don't
2016-09-09 09:48:10	liste	[09:20:44] crem: does the keyencoding parameter in Shelf constructor help?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	crem	[09:22:15] Hm, will try, maybe it's possible to set it to None or something like identity function
2016-09-09 09:48:10	crem	[09:24:12] Will probably do dbm + pickle manually.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	deniska	[09:24:43] crem: I suggest against using pickle for long term storage

2016-09-09 09:48:10	BytesAndCoffee	[09:29:04] among other reasons
2016-09-09 09:48:10	BytesAndCoffee	[09:29:16] ChrisWarrick: surprisingly often

2016-09-09 09:48:10	ChrisWarrick	[09:29:59] BytesAndCoffee: well, I don’t think I do very often if ever. Hard if your functions have more than 1 argument. Useless if you need to save the intermediate values.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	BytesAndCoffee	[09:30:25] ChrisWarrick: 1: tuples
2016-09-09 09:48:10	BytesAndCoffee	[09:30:33] 2: partial pipelines

2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:21:37] vbgunz: what versions do you need to support?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	vbgunz	[16:21:49] nedbat: I'd just like to support as much as possible
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:22:08] vbgunz: well, you have to really choose. Supporting 3.2 is hard. 3.0 and 3.1 are completely useless.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	simpson	[16:22:19] I don't know how I feel about UTF-8 by default. It is definitely better than almost everything else, but I don't know if it's better than TypeError.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	vbgunz	[16:22:39] tox tests are passing in version 2.7 and 3.5, I'm trying to end up with a pip universal wheel package
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:22:41] Afternoon. I've been having difficulties with the multiprocessing module. https://paste.pound-python.org/show/tLnP1BntgIgqyPrS1p20/
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:22:47] vbgunz: generally, testing on the lowest versions is better than the highest versions, so if you have to have only two versions, 2.7 and 3.4 might be better.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:23:00] If anyone has any insight, I would greatly appreciate it.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	eevee	[16:23:46] simpson: i'm okay with utf-8 as a canonical default way to serialize text to bytes in the absence of other useful information
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:23:55] Zequal: you aren't using multiprocessing here.  What's the problem you're struggling with?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	eevee	[16:23:57] and the "current code page" on windows appears to not be useful information
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:24:55] nedbat: Well, I've tried the multiprocessing.Pool, but pool.map(process_job(work)) won't work.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:25:55] Zequal: seems like you'd want pool.map(process_job, work), or something like it
2016-09-09 16:47:11	MnemoniX	[16:26:13] Man oh man, im gonna get Flamed On lol. Question: I need to build a tool , Chat reader, Screen scraper, Bottom line, i need to have a script that scans a chat windows looking for a Leader, then copies that text and pastes it else where. Is python up to the Job??
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:26:19] Zequal: maybe:  pool.map(process_job, get_jobs())
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:26:45] nedbat: What if I want another argument for that function, process_job?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:27:32] Zequal: looks like you need to pack them into a tuple or list, and have get_jobs() return an iterable of those.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	simpson	[16:28:27] eevee: Yeah, I know. I'm just...I don't want my code getting lazy~
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:28:51] nedbat: Okay, just to confirm. I am not expecting any result from these function calls. Is Pool the right class for this?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:29:32] Zequal: i
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:29:45] Zequal: i'm not an expert on this, but i think it's what you want.  does it work for you?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:30:04] nedbat: I'll give it a shot. Give me a few minutes. ;)
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nanonyme	[16:36:14] Ew, multiprocessing :(
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:36:56] Wait, this makes no sense.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:37:40] map(func, iterable) ... If the function expects 2 arguments, the item from the iterable as an argument - how is that going to work?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:38:00] Zequal: i think you need to unpack the item into 2 arguments yourself.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	_habnabit	[16:38:00] Zequal, you have to make the function take one argument and unpack it
2016-09-09 16:47:11	karnank	[16:38:10] this might seem like a stupid questio, but here it is anyway. I have a string "aa \n aa \n aa" I want to use the print function (python3) to properly print it in 3 lines. Is it possible or will I need to split it?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	_habnabit	[16:38:21] karnank, did you try it?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	karnank	[16:38:34] it prints in a single line
2016-09-09 16:47:11	_habnabit	[16:38:37] karnank, show us
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Zequal	[16:38:43] Ah...
2016-09-09 16:47:11	d3x	[16:39:51] karnank, did it print with \n or just "aa  aa  aa"?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	karnank	[16:40:10] with \n
2016-09-09 16:47:11	_habnabit	[16:40:33] karnank, so, pastebin the code and output?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	karnank	[16:40:52] yeah i think i have a different issue here
2016-09-09 16:47:11	d3x	[16:40:58] Where does that string come from?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	karnank	[16:41:20] stdout.readline().decode('utf-8')
2016-09-09 16:47:11	_habnabit	[16:41:27] karnank, showing code+output should be the first step if you're having a problem
2016-09-09 16:47:11	BytesAndCoffee	[16:41:57] _habnabit: did you see the new version of my class?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	_habnabit	[16:42:11] BytesAndCoffee, i didn't click the link
2016-09-09 16:47:11	karnank	[16:42:15] from subprocess, but yeah i figured directly printing should not print \n so its some other issue
2016-09-09 16:47:11	BytesAndCoffee	[16:42:32] _habnabit: http://i.imgur.com/3J8mX3n.png
2016-09-09 16:47:11	nedbat	[16:42:56] BytesAndCoffee: why a screenshot?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	_habnabit	[16:43:07] karnank, sure. and so if you show us the output and code and say "shouldn't this do something else?" it reduces the RTT since a fix can be suggested immediately
2016-09-09 16:47:11	BytesAndCoffee	[16:43:11] oops
2016-09-09 16:47:11	karnank	[16:44:04] thanks _habnabit I figured it in the process of writing that code and output thing :)
2016-09-09 16:47:11	_habnabit	[16:44:37] karnank, another good outcome
2016-09-09 16:47:11	BytesAndCoffee	[16:45:31] nedbat: _habnabit: https://github.com/BytesAndCoffee/Portfolio/tree/master
2016-09-09 16:47:11	BytesAndCoffee	[16:46:46] FrozenFunction takes a function, and creates a callable of that function, but with the arguments as parameters, as well as being able to set parameters outside of calling it

2016-09-09 18:01:09	karnank	Hi I am trying to use subprocess.Popen() to run a background cli process, is it the right function to achieve that.
2016-09-09 18:01:10	nedbat	BPL: though that doesn't fix it
2016-09-09 18:01:15	karnank	The issue I am facing is the background process is interactive, i.e. it waits for the input from frontend and responds with output. I am using Popen.communicate() to send input to the subprocess but what actually happens is that the process terminates when the communicate returns (https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.c
2016-09-09 18:01:15	karnank	ommunicate) So can the communicate not work till the process terminates?
