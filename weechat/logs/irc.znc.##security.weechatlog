2016-09-01 14:20:32	bsdnoob	[13:48:05] shouldn't it do the opposite to hide secret ?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	bsdnoob	[13:48:11] like return everthing else except secret ?

Not just for IPsec, but also for e.g. TCP sequence numbers, enabling IP spoofing. It is not used for /dev/[u]random however, so user space processes cannot easily detect this.

2016-09-01 15:39:19	Waldo	if theres an SQL backend theres a config file connecting to that DB.
2016-09-01 15:39:27	Waldo	try to LFI that config file, the user running the webserver has access.
2016-09-01 15:39:33	toothe	not one that's exposed. They blocked all SQL ports.
2016-09-01 15:39:44	toothe	so, which file would that be? that sounds like a great idea.
2016-09-01 15:39:48	Waldo	Thats fine homie but you gotta think OVERALL
2016-09-01 15:39:54	Waldo	theres a lot you can test with an LFI
2016-09-01 15:40:10	Waldo	so you can LFI the websites config file, It WONT appear to the client, why?  Because PHP is parsed serverside
2016-09-01 15:40:21	Waldo	toothe: so to even view that file youll have to learn how to properly LFI php

2016-09-01 15:40:57	toothe	yes.Its Nginx, but the config looks pretty minimal....I'd love to know where the "root" directory for this vhost is.
2016-09-01 15:41:00	Waldo	you can test the LFI, maybe its an RFI!

2016-09-01 15:45:01	Waldo	So i played with this WordPress LFI once.  What it would do is access the file, turn it into a jpeg, and attach it to a post. You could then view the file if you saw the wordpress post.  It was a true LFI though, it simply displayed contents of file accessed in the system.  I say not a true LFI because you couldnt use it to parse any PHP 
2016-09-01 15:45:07	Waldo	toothe: is this the type of LFI you encountered?
2016-09-01 15:45:26	Thracky	this doesn't seem like an LFI, since it's not "including" the file
2016-09-01 15:45:28	toothe	if you're asking if it renders a file, it doesn't...
2016-09-01 15:45:33	toothe	I am not certain what you mean by "true".
2016-09-01 15:45:39	Thracky	it's just a directory traversal from the sounds of it

Stick it in, try to automatically grab whatever we can, make sure write operations are fail-safe; idea being for something like a SWAT or similar operation, you're in, you slap it in a computer you see, you yoink it out when you have to bail.

2016-09-01 21:41:54	SporkWitch	wilsonfisk: the problem on the windows side is the limitation of "you must use powershell" or require some crazier access.  On linux, adding a new udev rule is trivial
2016-09-01 21:42:24	@wilsonfisk	ooh, yea. Wasn't even thinking of powershell && other requirements.

2016-09-01 21:42:44	@wilsonfisk	I get to use Linux this entire semester (except for Math :?) which is neat :D
2016-09-01 21:42:59	SporkWitch	wilsonfisk: it's fresh in my mind, because you use a udev rule to call a shell script to lock the screen, to make lock-on-remove work with smartcards / tokens
2016-09-01 21:43:21	@wilsonfisk	oh yea, you were talking about those the other day.
2016-09-01 21:43:22	SporkWitch	amusingly, i basically had to write it myself, since the version of the scripts on all the tutorials is outdated and doesn't apply to KDE5 lol

2016-09-01 21:44:02	SporkWitch	(by the time i got done, all his logic is still there, but all his logic was just to figure out what DE you were using so it would know how to lock the screen; i had to completely replace the part that tells it how to lock KDE lol)
2016-09-01 21:44:58	@wilsonfisk	yea... that's definitely more complicated than *nix :X
2016-09-01 21:45:21	@wilsonfisk	Keybase has a win client now I think... haven't look at that though.

2016-09-01 21:46:38	SporkWitch	and yeah, they fixed the bug in the windows client that would bluescreen if you clicked on a symlink someone just happened to put in the dir and points to something that doesnt' exist on your local machine...
2016-09-01 21:47:41	SporkWitch	(was buggering about with it with some mates a couple weeks ago, i put a symlink to something in there, had him click it, and a few minutes later he timed out and then logged back in, it apparently bluescreened when he tried to open it; then he bluescreened again when he opened the parent folder and windows tried to load the thumbnail, since i named the symlink with a .jpg extension lol)

2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:00] boot on the iso
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:52:00] Apachez, I was talking about if the hyper-v host itself got infected
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:01] scan
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:02] done!
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:52:11] obvious with vm's you can boot any iso you damn well please
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:12] well that would suck
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:25] but then you should have backups of the vm guests disk files
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:27] offlne...
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:30] so if shit hits the fan
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:52:30] we do
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:37] wipe, reinstall, restore from backup
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:52:42] I just like to be paranoid
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:52:43] back on track within 1 hour give or take
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:53:05] I can't believe that isp that got scammed
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:53:08] problem with todays malware is that the good ones you need to replace hardware too :P
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:53:12] 30 mill was it?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:53:19] like even a stripped box still have bios memory that can be modified
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:53:27] jtag
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:53:28] the firmware of any cd/dvd player/burners
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:53:37] hell even some batteries have firmwares nowadays
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:53:48] dont forget the SSD/HDD you got in the vm host
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:53:51] yeah I know
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:53:57] not much I can do about that
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:54:01] got firmware too and could be replaced to survive a wipe
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:54:20] also to shorten the restore you could take an image of the vmhost itself
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:54:24] without any vmguests of course
2016-09-02 14:13:21	 *	fishhead [13:54:40] bites robattila256 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:54:44] so you have restored the host in like less than 5 minutes (assuming you use RAID1 SSD or such)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:54:58] and then every now and then create a new restore image
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:55:04] so you got the hotfixes already in place
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:55:19] I thought about solder modding in some write protect jumpers on bios;s etc
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:55:26] not at work though
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:56:14] also another quickfix is to have prepared disks so you just rip out the assumed malwarized disks and in with the new and then startup the box again
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:56:22] restore vm's from trusted backup and off you go
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:56:28] so a restore is done in less than 15 minutes or so
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:56:38] anyways I answered my own question when I remembered the host isn't part of the ss software raid so
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[13:56:39] then the ripped out drives can be used to further analyze the breakin
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:56:41] it's all good
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:56:58] not always an option Apachez but I do dd them sometimes
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:57:06] to another drive
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:58:56] rafael, since you are polish, shouldn't your host me pl.chello.static.234-11-10-84 ?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fishhead	[13:59:00] me/be
2016-09-02 14:13:21	 *	fishhead [13:59:08] ducks
2016-09-02 14:13:21	 *	fishhead [13:59:44] wonders if anyone got the calculator joke
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Apachez	[14:01:34] using TI calculator much? ;)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	 *	lrvick [14:03:58] just fished out a TI last night to play with custom firmware
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Poeticode	[14:07:55] that classic Super Mario game + editor on the TI83 always blows my mind
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Poeticode	[14:09:01] I think there was recently a language released that compiles to asm, so lots of awesome games are finding their way on the TIs
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Poeticode	[14:09:28] Axe, it's called

2016-09-02 17:57:00	@sartan	soooo on the flikp side, it's computationally cheap to calculate hash, and cheap to refer to a repDB on the internet somewhere, so it doesn't HURT to do that

2016-09-02 17:57:40	Apachez	first thought before that ooooooooooooh shiiiiiiiiiii... was "wtf did I have to manually scan it for!? great idea Apachez  really great!"
2016-09-02 17:58:11	Apachez	I mean sure signatures (like hashes) are good to identify known bad stuff
2016-09-02 17:58:22	Apachez	but a good av shouldnt really hash on the file but rather on the bad content
2016-09-02 17:58:36	Apachez	but its still tricky because there are shitloads of ways to obfuscate it
2016-09-02 17:58:45	Apachez	its like when you want to bypass the filter in any bluecoat product
2016-09-02 17:58:56	Apachez	just double encode your bytes (or better yet unicode :) and you will pass :D
2016-09-02 17:59:04	Apachez	answer from bluecoat "its by design"
2016-09-02 17:59:21	Apachez	what happens is that bluecoat when it receives the packet will only attempt to decode once

2016-09-02 18:00:22	Apachez	and once it did that THEN it will execute whatever url your request (or posted)

2016-09-03 13:03:54	devonrevenge	I just realised I made a mistake installing blackarch - its not going to be updated and supported as much as arch arch-or is it similar to arch enough?
2016-09-03 13:04:10	devonrevenge	sorry wrong room
2016-09-03 13:05:12	markerz18	devonrevenge, blackarch is arch
2016-09-03 13:05:19	remote	if it's based on arch you can install arch packages on it
2016-09-03 13:05:21	markerz18	it just is customized for pentesting

2016-09-03 13:07:53	markerz18	devonrevenge, just note if you install it to HD, you may not be able to boot it unless you manually install the syslinux bootloader.

2016-09-03 13:08:40	remote	are there tools out there that allows you to do this easily?
2016-09-03 13:09:30	devonrevenge	yeah because I had this bar that would load straight away and these errors were building up I installed arch badly after deciding to re-install it froc scratch
2016-09-03 13:09:39	danderian	devonrevenge: I hate it because during any important upgrade, you waste tons of time fixing driver/core issues

2016-09-03 13:10:00	devonrevenge	yeah thats my issue I guess
2016-09-03 13:10:11	markerz18	the only reason i dont like to install arch, is because my mousepad is not compatible with it. 
2016-09-03 13:10:20	devonrevenge	nah I re-installed so much I cant be assed to do it by hand
2016-09-03 13:10:24	devonrevenge	it is a pain
2016-09-03 13:10:29	danderian	markerz18: yes, 1 of many reasons.. it's not compatible with most modern hardware
2016-09-03 13:10:42	remote	use universal mousepads

2016-09-03 13:11:46	markerz18	danderian, its compatible with basically everything. its just that im running an alienware laptop which comes with a killer wireless card (which linux distros of all kind dont supprt) as well as a mousepad (only arch doesnt support it by default, but it is adable)

2016-09-03 13:12:22	danderian	I got debian installed almost everywhere. I can't say the same for arch
2016-09-03 13:12:42	markerz18	lol danderian installing blackarch isnt that hard.
2016-09-03 13:12:48	danderian	forget it markerz18 . I hate arch and that's a fact lol

2016-09-03 13:13:26	markerz18	danderian, blackarch installs all the complex shit that makes you want to kill yourself by default. literally just run a single command and it all installs with the GUI ready to go
2016-09-03 13:13:29	danderian	yes ShoarAu ... but if you happen to have an OS upgrade, you probably get your display drivers fucked up
2016-09-03 13:13:35	danderian	it happened to me.. twice
2016-09-03 13:13:50	markerz18	danderian, now arch linux itself without the blackarch build, that is hard as hell and id rather kill myself XD
2016-09-03 13:13:56	danderian	maybe newer versions are more stable
2016-09-03 13:14:10	danderian	but I'm talking about 2/3 yrs ago
2016-09-03 13:14:17	ShoarAu	it's "bleeding edge"
2016-09-03 13:14:31	ShoarAu	so yea you will have more problems probably then for example Debian
2016-09-03 13:14:34	ShoarAu	stable*

2016-09-04 12:32:21	@wilsonfisk	[11:40:25] so instead of 'Hey... where did this kitteh come from?'; it's 'Hey... why is this door open?'.  He was covering his tracks.

2016-09-04 13:53:12	x0fsec	all passwords and password sec is almost out of date since quantum encryption is already being tested by multiple countries.. in which China sent a satelite into space to test it out with space to ground communications/speedetc..
2016-09-04 13:53:18	x0fsec	just sayin :)
2016-09-04 13:53:25	wilhelmtell	Oh no but per site ...
2016-09-04 13:53:31	merced	will quantum computing really break encryption though?
2016-09-04 13:53:40	x0fsec	merced, the other way around..

2016-09-04 13:54:01	SquadGoals	x0fsec, you use debian ?
2016-09-04 13:54:05	x0fsec	true encryption.
2016-09-04 13:54:09	joepie91	wilhelmtell: but yes, if you use a password manager that generates per-site passwords for you, you're probably going to be fine

2016-09-04 13:56:17	wilhelmtell	I think it's all a game. I think there are few spots you ought to keep strong, and little else matters. Keep email strong, GPG if you have, you computers, and I think that's it. Everything else is accessible to anyone if they have you machine or your email ..
2016-09-04 13:56:24	SquadGoals	cause if i could put my header anywhere i'd put it in a different usb. then use that to open up the system

2016-09-06 11:21:04	rascuache	[11:00:42] is there a more effective way to block psexecing other than stopping ports 445 and 139?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	rascuache	[11:01:24] client has symantec endpoint which blocks the default executable but not the msf version
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Jack64	[11:02:04] rascuache: there's a couple of regkeys you can set
2016-09-06 11:21:04	drizbit	[11:02:09] the remote used needs admin rights to use psexec
2016-09-06 11:21:04	drizbit	[11:02:30] if they dont need root, dont give it to them
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Jack64	[11:02:55] rascuache: http://colesec.inventedtheinternet.com/tag/pass-the-hash/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	Jack64	[11:03:16] do the opposite of that
2016-09-06 11:21:04	ExeciN	[11:06:27] who summoned me?

2016-09-06 11:21:04	rascuache	[11:08:06] hm interesting, thanks
2016-09-06 11:21:04	rascuache	[11:08:24] so client has 2fa on their main server
2016-09-06 11:21:04	rascuache	[11:08:29] but only for rdp :/
2016-09-06 11:21:04	rascuache	[11:08:42] so psexec worked just fine

2016-09-06 14:15:16	FortunateSon	it doesn't have to be a gamble.  I know of some companies that will pay for you to relocate and give you a guaranteed 6 mo. of salary 
2016-09-06 14:16:23	FortunateSon	Texas is a right-to-work state so there aren't many contract jobs, but that also means that if you land a job and are competent you wont get fired/laid off very easily

2016-09-06 14:23:35	FortunateSon	SporkWitch: My opinion?  I don't think I should be forced to join a group and pay part of my salary in order to get a job.  If you want the option you should have it, but to FORCE people who do NOT want to be in a union to join one ... no thanks.  It seems too much like socialism to me. But that is only my opinion.  I'm not against unions, I am against FORCED unionism.

2016-09-06 20:43:27	joepie91	[18:56:20] more details concerning ZenMate: https://www.lowendtalk.com/discussion/91331/zenmate-now-mitming-connections
2016-09-06 20:43:27	noDoZeV2	[19:08:09] test
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:10:46] joepie91: wrong conclusions there
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:11:03] there is simply no httpS involved on either side of the connection
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Sonicwall_	[19:11:35] ????
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:12:14] curl --verbose 'http://store.steampowered.com/app/363930/l=dutch' 
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:12:24] returns the full web page, no redirections
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:14:35] so blame both, steam for not enforcing https, and zenmate users for thinking they'll get a free non-invasive service from a revenue driven organization.
2016-09-06 20:43:27	joepie91	[19:16:46] tomreyn: can you name a domain of a store that does a redirect to TLS, but does NOT uses HSTS?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	joepie91	[19:16:58] actually nevermind, the person reporting it already uninstalled it
2016-09-06 20:43:27	joepie91	[19:17:55] tomreyn: updated the post btw
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:19:30] there are still a lot of online shops / stores which do not enforce HTTPS until you reach the checkout phase
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:19:47] and those obviously don't use hsts
2016-09-06 20:43:27	korain	[19:20:27] oh
2016-09-06 20:43:27	korain	[19:20:39] wrong window
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:20:50] others do offer to use https everywhere (if you explictly request it) but don't enforce it until the checkout.
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:21:16] and yet others don't offer https at all ;)
2016-09-06 20:43:27	tomreyn	[19:22:07] but aside of that last category, all of them can pass pci compliance. which is sick.

2016-09-06 23:41:04	eeeprom	as far as i understand it is to check the integrity of the file from a data standpoint, to ensure its not corrupted
2016-09-06 23:41:43	eeeprom	although it could be used for security too. what you're saying sounds possible, if someone really wanted to swap for a malicious file, one would think they would be able to change the checksum too.

2016-09-06 23:43:15	eeeprom	every file has a checksum, and if any data in the file is changed, so is the checksum. when you download a file, the checksum should be the same after you download it, meaning you have an identical copy. if it were corrupted, the checksum would be different. for example if there was an error while downloading.
2016-09-06 23:43:53	eeeprom	or if the same file is in multiple places and should be the same, but one file has a different checksum, maybe it is incomplete or different somehow. a way of checking this

2016-09-07 02:15:22	@wilsonfisk	[23:19:42] web chat clients have been quieted for months.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:39:21] what's the point of providing a hash for a file when downloading a file? (e.g. HASH=... check it after download)
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:39:33] in case of the file being changed by someone into something malicious
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:39:46] if that's the case isn't the malicious user at the point where they could also modify the hash posted?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	eeeprom	[23:41:04] as far as i understand it is to check the integrity of the file from a data standpoint, to ensure its not corrupted
2016-09-07 02:15:22	eeeprom	[23:41:43] although it could be used for security too. what you're saying sounds possible, if someone really wanted to swap for a malicious file, one would think they would be able to change the checksum too.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:42:22] eeeprom: in what case would a file that's already uploaded to a site get corrupted?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	eeeprom	[23:43:15] every file has a checksum, and if any data in the file is changed, so is the checksum. when you download a file, the checksum should be the same after you download it, meaning you have an identical copy. if it were corrupted, the checksum would be different. for example if there was an error while downloading.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	eeeprom	[23:43:53] or if the same file is in multiple places and should be the same, but one file has a different checksum, maybe it is incomplete or different somehow. a way of checking this
2016-09-07 02:15:22	eeeprom	[23:44:06] I could be wrong. but thats my understanding.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	eeeprom	[23:45:23] I think some package management software compares checksums from the repository to your computer to make sure the files you are downloading are good
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:45:52] eeeprom: that makes a lot more sense than what i was thinking
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:45:54] thanks
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:46:13] another question, why do people on certain sites remove the http part and write stuff like hxxp?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	pepee	[23:46:14] does anyone know of a channel where people discuss hardware hacks and repurposed stuff?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:46:21] does it have something to do with indexing?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	maktm	[23:46:35] pepee: ##re maybe?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	pepee	[23:47:16] hmm, I don't remember reading stuff like that in ##re , but yeah, seems somehow related

2016-09-07 02:15:22	 *	wilsonfisk [01:24:28] already knows if 'Sh*t's magic. Don't question it.' :)
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@wilsonfisk	[01:25:37] would save NIST a *whole* lotta time. heh.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	sad-pone	[01:25:46] it was pretty good, especially for keeping unwanted poorly written adware from using massive amounts of internet.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@wilsonfisk	[01:26:06] are you sure it was Kaspersky? or you torrenting?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	sad-pone	[01:26:24] yeah, it was the old kaspersky anti hacker
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@wilsonfisk	[01:27:22] so it was like FF's plug-in container?  Gives the user a false sense of hope?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	sad-pone	[01:27:22] then they made whatever they have now, i  think that was after they got bought out
2016-09-07 02:15:22	sad-pone	[01:27:48] i think it was just a firewall interface

2016-09-07 09:43:19	Thracky	[09:05:04] oh for sure
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ibwilbur	[09:05:13] i've encountered auditors like that
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ibwilbur	[09:05:32] all you can do is stare at them
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:06:33] when pen testing those types of systems, do they give you access to the sticky notes the admins keep stuck to their monitor that have the current pass on them?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:07:32] eh... nevermind. no one is in disagreement here.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:08:27] ibwilbur: lovely thread
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:08:45] however I would assume his request was to see if the customer actually do store the sensitive data properly
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:09:01] and if they would violate the policy or not in order to provide him with the requested data
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ibwilbur	[09:09:02] quite possible
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:09:36] I mean if you would just "sure, here are all our accounts and their passwords in cleartext" would render a big fat F for FAILED :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ibwilbur	[09:09:56] i had an auditor get pissed that i redacted some shadow files that i gave to him
2016-09-07 09:43:19	rasmoo	[09:10:05] considering that he kept insisting to get the data
2016-09-07 09:43:19	rasmoo	[09:10:10] there was no way to pass the audition
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:10:40] give him the shadow file, rerender all passwords before he gets that old shadow :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:10:52] enjoy the show when he tries to pass the hash and whatelse which doesnt work =)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ibwilbur	[09:10:56] it was a former job. thankfully not there any longer
2016-09-07 09:43:19	rasmoo	[09:11:01] he wanted plaintext :x
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:11:20] then create new passwords
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:11:23] store cleartext
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:11:26] leave it to him
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:11:30] create new passwords
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:11:31] done
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:11:47] so once he get that excel spreadsheet the passwords is no longer valid
2016-09-07 09:43:19	rascuache	[09:11:54] the new l0phtcrack has pw auditing features so you can like automatically change passwords that crack out in a set amount of time
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:11:58] and you can have passwords such as "H1LLARYsucksDICK!!!"
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:12:00] and such :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	ibwilbur	[09:12:23] that's awesome
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:12:36] or dox the auditor
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:12:46] use part of his/her personal info as passwords
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:12:50] and leave it out on paper
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Apachez	[09:12:52] :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:24:09] i'm going to sleep. it turns out that --with-socks has something to do with /etc/socks.conf but i'm too tired for it right now. I got socat 70% working but 70% working is as good as 0% unless I can get it to fully work lol
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Cypher-Punk	[09:29:32] Semi off-topic. What's a good size flash drive for booting off of? I'm looking at getting like five to have different operating systems to boot whenever.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Cypher-Punk	[09:29:45] 16gb should cover everything out there, yeah?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Thracky	[09:30:12] I think 16 is reasonable yeah
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Thracky	[09:30:37] so I can't stand it when vendors keep their security advisories behind official customer support portals :|
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:30:46] I use sandisk cruzers from ebay... ~$6 each and maybe counterfeit but I've never had one cook out like I have had with a silicone power one
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Cypher-Punk	[09:33:15] I'm only looking at USB 3.0 ones, because there's no kill like overkill. I was debating on getting 16gb or 32gb ones. I believe the 16gb should hold any OS that I want to throw on it and saves me some money.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:33:49] Cypher-Punk: this is not ##security related
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:34:15] Cypher-Punk: also, I own about 12 sandisk ultra fit cruzers, of 16gb size
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:34:51] just keep in mind that if you lose your flash drive or it dies.... you'd better have a backup 
2016-09-07 09:43:19	masterkorp	[09:35:41] Cypher-Punk: are you looking for a weather resistent one?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:35:41] I had a silicone power drive die once because I enabled iptables logging on it and it got cooked. Eventually I figured out that if I stripped off the rubber cover and put a floor fan blowing on it, I could actually run it for long enough to clone it.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Cypher-Punk	[09:35:46] Sorry, yeah I said "semi off-topic" before I brought it up. I didn't see any active conversations at the moment so I thought I'd ask for advice.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:36:25] Cypher-Punk: try ##hardware if you want advice on weather resistant drives or such....
2016-09-07 09:43:19	anarc0der	[09:38:04] hi all
2016-09-07 09:43:19	masterkorp	[09:38:20] Cypher-Punk: http://www.lacie.com/as/en/products/usb-keys/xtremkey/
2016-09-07 09:43:19	masterkorp	[09:38:23] i love these
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:41:02] masterkorp: he did implicitly indicate that his budget was around $5... and I'd recommend just getting a water proof pill container and some smaller drives
2016-09-07 09:43:19	catfishes	[09:41:47] when you're running your OS off a flash drive, you don't want something huge and made of steel. something like that + laptop = broken usb port in short order

2016-09-07 10:31:47	HEROnymous	rootkits could certainly need security updates.
2016-09-07 10:31:49	ecdhe	HEROnymous, I'm trying to find counter examples to the idea that pretty much everything should probably be loaded from an app store or repo.

2016-09-07 10:32:22	ecdhe	I agree.
2016-09-07 10:32:29	HEROnymous	managing software without a packaging and repository system is a pain in the ass.

2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:03:50] stevenxl, ok... inspect element, firebug, etc.. there are a number of tools to view JS
2016-09-07 17:22:11	cnap	[17:03:56] stevenxl: use Firefox, open console with Ctrl Shift I, go to debugger, refresh the page, look for the file your interested in, open it, find the line you want to set the breakpoint and double click on the left sidebar
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:04:10] most browsers have js debuggers
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:04:40] if you want to change that JS in real time, you may need something like burp, or a web proxy
2016-09-07 17:22:11	cnap	[17:04:50] stevenxl: also keep in mind that you can still intercept the AJAX requests with burp in case that helps
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:05:21] thanks guys - I'm trying to stay away from using other tools aside from what comes w/ the browser debugging suite
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:05:32] stevenxl, which browser?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:05:37] only because that will increase complexity. Let me try with the debugging tools
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:05:43] I have Chrome and Firefox
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:05:50] stevenxl, those are fine for the job mate
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:05:52] goodluck
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:06:03] you can inspect/edit HTML output and put 'debugger;'  which will act as a breakpoint in Chrome and FF/FireBug
2016-09-07 17:22:11	cnap	[17:06:03] I think you can also see the requests in chrome maybe firefox too
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:06:21] cnap, yeh there are plugins for it I ams ure
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@TheJH	[17:06:25] jabberwock: why so complicated? you can just directly set breakpoints in the script view
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:06:27] request maker, etc..
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:06:40] Yeh, point and click with debugger
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:06:47] TheJH: I think a few of us have explained that to them
2016-09-07 17:22:11	cnap	[17:06:50] jabberwock: yeah ask me right? In that salesforce site they left debugger; instructions everywhere and im trying to get XSS and its pissing me off 
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:06:52] I think that the script is being downloaded, makes soem functions available, and then thsoe functions are never executed
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:06:53] they're still asking, so I'm thinking outside the box
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:07:02] I'm trying to look for xhr requests in the network tab but i don't see any.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:07:18] cnap: lol. hooray for code reviews
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:07:18] heh
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:07:29] I'm just confused as to how this website is getting data on the page. I look at the page source and it's bare bones, so it has to be fetching the data and then using js to put it in there.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:07:31] in the dom
2016-09-07 17:22:11	cnap	[17:07:34] jabberwock: :)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:07:57] stevenxl: In FireBug go to Network->XHR and then refresh
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:08:23] stevenxl, you should be able to right-click in the Developer Tools console, and click "Enable XMLHttpRequest logging
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:08:27] x0fsec / cnap / jabberwock thanks folks I'll give it a try.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:08:34] stevenxl, goodluck mang
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:08:35] x0fsec: never used that before
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:08:35] cool
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:09:05] ok.. thats in chrome, and it will allow the xhr to show in the console
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:09:06] thanks. I'm just trying to get the data from this site. I thougth maybe it would make xhr requests that I could then emulate, but doesn't seem to be doing that. so I gotta figure out how its getting the data.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:09:09] just fyi
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:09:11] cool
2016-09-07 17:22:11	stevenxl	[17:09:18] yea definitely a tool i can use
2016-09-07 17:22:11	x0fsec	[17:09:24] coo
2016-09-07 17:22:11	soulisson	[17:11:02] jabberwock, I don't remember does the client prints out the html markup when html rendering is disabled?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:11:16] Probably
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:11:33] otherwise it's doing rendering instead of plaintext
2016-09-07 17:22:11	soulisson	[17:11:46] ok, it could also remove it
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:12:04] anything is possible :)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	soulisson	[17:12:21] I haven't been using an email client for such a long time :)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:12:49] Have you even done a vuln assessment on your webmail?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:13:02] Looking for things like missing security headers, missing CSRF tokens etc.?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	jabberwock	[17:13:11] CORS
2016-09-07 17:22:11	soulisson	[17:13:22] nop :)

2016-09-07 21:02:38	mystica555	[18:03:35] CaptainAndreyasn: am i the only one who associates this face with the name "krebs" : http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/8/80/Mr._Krabs.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20150919162131

2016-09-07 21:02:38	CaptainAndreyasn	[18:09:21] I have a bunch of feeds that I follow, but most of them don't report much of worth most of the time.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	CaptainAndreyasn	[18:10:33] most of the time, a google news category of computer security works best.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	@wilsonfisk	[18:15:19] No one ever believes me when I say Google :P
2016-09-07 21:02:38	mystica555	[18:17:33] wilsonfisk: the algorithm knows all...
2016-09-07 21:02:38	mystica555	[18:17:40] in thus lies the power, and the danger.

2016-09-07 21:02:38	CaptainAndreyasn	[18:24:13] wilsonfisk: I like google, but I like to make sure I get my news from multiple sources. Since google is kinda the default answer for anything, it's often not even mentioned, but you are right, it is the best single source.

2016-09-07 21:02:38	Apachez	[20:44:59] 128 bits 
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Apachez	[20:45:26] so probably md5 : salt
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Apachez	[20:45:43] since SHA1 is 160 bits if I recall it correctly

2016-09-08 10:38:49	ma3str0	[10:29:47] healthcare, retirement, etc
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:30:07] often NDA's mean you can't talk at all about the work you are doing, some even don't allow you say who you were working for
2016-09-08 10:38:49	darkhorizon	[10:30:29] ma3str0: Good point, I'll have to factor that in to my rate I suppose.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	darkhorizon	[10:30:39] ciaranmak: How common is that in the industry?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@wilsonfisk	[10:30:41] or when you did the work.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:31:01] have been contracting the past year and a half as a freelancer, hardest part is maintaining a steady flow of work, I don;t take contracts longer than a month though
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:31:32] NDA's are very common and likely if you are getting a contract there will be one
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:31:56] most of them are fairly straight forward
2016-09-08 10:38:49	pagios	[10:32:41] i have a wpa2 network and want to see from my laptop the traffic originating from my phone which is also connected to the wifi router. network is wpa2, can i do that in wireshark? should i supply the wp2 password to decrypt the traffic? is it like snooping on a hub when done?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	darkhorizon	[10:34:02] Well that sucks. So for future positions I would only be able to advertise the products I've worked with. Not how it was applied or what company it was used for. Ouch
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:34:08] ma3str0: is right, I'm working as a sole trader so I need to do all my own tax/insurance etc
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:34:32] but there are benefits and tax relief here anyway for sole traders (ireland)
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:35:07] darkhorizon: the only way I've been able to advertise the security work I've done is by doing public bug bounties
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:35:20] that has got me about 25% of my contract work
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:36:03] the rest is mostly by referral but as I only do short contracts I've likely had more clients than one would doing a year long one
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ciaranmak	[10:36:21] hope it helps with the decision anyway 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	darkhorizon	[10:37:33] ciaranmak: it gives me a lot to think about, thanks. Public bug bounties sounds like a really good idea. Direct referrals probably wouldn't be an option for this position unfortunately.

Yes firewalls some firewalls might send a RST but most firewalls will also drop a SYN/ACK even if the targeted port is open and even if the firewall sends a RST is the packet ID gets incremented, the logic is the same

2016-09-08 18:14:47	ryonaloli	seanrdev: for openvpn, you can usually (if the vpn supports it) add "redirect-gateway def1" to the config file to enable pushing dns requests upstream. then simply block all non-dns traffic.
2016-09-08 18:14:53	ryonaloli	er
2016-09-08 18:14:56	ryonaloli	block all non-vpn traffic
2016-09-08 18:15:20	ryonaloli	the easiest way to do that is force openvpn to run as a dedicated openvpn group, then have an iptables rule disallow outgoing traffic which isn't coming from the openvpn group

2016-09-08 18:18:59	ryao	ryonaloli: Not necessarily. You can do anonymity via Tor, visa gift cards purchased in person, a seedbox and nordic VPN.
2016-09-08 18:19:11	ryao	At least, it looks like you can. I have never tried.
2016-09-08 18:19:13	ryonaloli	don't use vms for dns protection. and use iptables with openvpn in a dedicated group. that way you won't have to worry about starting openvpn early or late.
2016-09-08 18:19:36	ryao	Tor is useful for setting things up. Then you can use nordic VPN to access the seedbox.

2016-09-08 18:19:50	ryonaloli	as for seedboxes, you can just use tor to access them instead of vpns
2016-09-08 18:19:59	ryonaloli	since tor is bad to torrent over, but it's fine to access a seedbox through ftp over

2016-09-09 11:20:02	iz	the secret about tech jobs is that degree/cert requirements aren't really requirements, but more of a wishlist
2016-09-09 11:20:12	enki__	Degree don't mean anything. Just show you have skill, willingness to learn and good character and you will be fine.

2016-09-09 16:47:11	StrumpZ	[16:42:17] rtfm-hysm: encrypted volume that he needs to decrypt when doing the backup, or how does that work?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	ShoarAu	[16:42:31] Waldo: first time i did mine i had some responses actually
2016-09-09 16:47:11	ShoarAu	[16:42:45] was pretty impressed because i was a dropout with little experience but huge knowledge
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:42:55] I thought the lack of programming langauges may hurt me, but im not applying for a developer position, so I think its OK that I only know bash
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:43:06] pentesters dont need to know fluent python right
2016-09-09 16:47:11	ryao	[16:43:30] Waldo: I wouldn't be the right person to answer that.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	rtfm-hysm	[16:43:44] StrumpZ I guess a volume that he would only access when really needed, like to make sure he wouldn't be searching on the internet and working with important files at the same time maybe
2016-09-09 16:47:11	 *	ryao [16:43:50] was talking about developer resumes.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:43:59] im not applying for developer positiong haha!

2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:44:03] I am not at that level lol
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:44:06] I wanna be a pentester

2016-09-09 16:47:11	ryao	[16:44:23] Waldo: i still think it helps not to lump HTML and bash into the same line. ;)
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:44:29] ryao: I took ur advice
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:44:30] dont worry lol
2016-09-09 16:47:11	StrumpZ	[16:44:39] rtfm: like i put in additional hdd in his system, encrypt the volume and he unlock only when doing backup?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	rtfm-hysm	[16:44:41] StrumpZ but in general the best option is to have always a backup, that's what most of people are saying
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:07] Theres that rule
2016-09-09 16:47:11	ryao	[16:45:07] Waldo: Being able to write your own tools sounds like a nice thing to me, but you should ask someone in the field like the guy in #pentoo.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:08] 3 backups
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:10] 1 in the cloud

2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:24] ryao: I can write my own tools
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:27] I HAVE written my own tools
2016-09-09 16:47:11	ryao	[16:45:34] Waldo: In bash?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:34] but I dont know python off the top of my head if u asked me
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:39] ryao: in bash and python
2016-09-09 16:47:11	StrumpZ	[16:45:41] the ransomware encrypted the files and put .enc at the end - Crypt0l0cker - any known tools to decrypt that, or just not ppossible or worth spending time on?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:46] ryao: mostly basdh
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:49] if were being honest
2016-09-09 16:47:11	rtfm-hysm	[16:45:51] StrumpZ, he should unlock only when working on those files, you could make a backup of the volume so a malware probably wouldn't find and encrypt the volume when not mounted
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:56] because most of the time its faster
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:45:59] but sometimes ive used python
2016-09-09 16:47:11	ryao	[16:46:03] Waldo: You can say minor python experience then.
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:46:07] Yes!
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:46:10] thats what i was wondering
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:46:11] so I CAN say that
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:46:20] maybe I link my scripts to prove it?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:46:26] idk

2016-09-09 16:47:11	rtfm-hysm	[16:46:58] StrumpZ there is a way to get the password but it really depends on the malware, some people would make a sandbox and take a dump of the memory while the malware is encrypting files to try to recover the password
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Waldo	[16:46:59] i can do it with reference

2016-09-09 17:10:13	ecdhe	So Waldo was asking lots of resume questions earlier, which leads me to wonder how one goes about transitioning from getting paid as an expert software dev to getting paid as a security expert...  a lot of certifications aren't worth it, there are running jokes about how little you can know and still have a CISSP: https://securityreactions.tumblr.com/search/cissp
2016-09-09 17:10:57	ecdhe	How do you take all you've learned and start getting paid for it without misrepresenting your skills on a resume?
2016-09-09 17:12:38	CaptainAndreyasn	not sure. But just because the cissp is teased as being worthless doesn't mean it actually is worthless. 
2016-09-09 17:13:12	CaptainAndreyasn	it's value is in how much more a company is willing to pay you if you have one.
2016-09-09 17:13:19	CaptainAndreyasn	and I don't know how much that is. :-/
2016-09-09 17:13:24	piou	ecdhe: a collegue of mine made that very transition from senior software architect to pentester through SANS certifications then asking to change team within the company. He first was assigned almost all code review missions that took advantage of his experience of code while letting him see his colleages do "real" pentests, then he naturally started doing it himself
2016-09-09 17:13:29	CaptainAndreyasn	but I suspect most certs are worth something.

2016-09-09 17:16:06	@Hydrogenum	you can't get a CISSP unless you've been working security for 5 years, so it's not relevant to someone trying to switch fields anyway
2016-09-09 17:16:16	ecdhe	CaptainAndreyasn, CISSP requires sponsorship from other CISSPs, it's not just a test you can pass and a fee you can pay --  you have to know someone or work with someone who will go to bat for you --- before you take a test that covers more about fire extinguisher placement than auditing your infrastructure in the wake of a CVE...

2016-09-09 17:17:36	@Hydrogenum	as for value: CISSP (and other certs) are useful if you want to be "the security guy" at a small company that doesn't know how to interview security people.  Large companies ignore the certs, since their interview process is better than the certs
2016-09-09 17:17:40	CaptainAndreyasn	also... if you don't have to know a cissp, they have a directory of people to work with if you don't know one.

2016-09-09 18:41:39	Waldo	Look guys you are entitled to your opinions and thats fine, but i strongly disagree.
2016-09-09 18:41:43	piou	beowuff: ha, but you're talking about a lone pentester. If you're part of a team it's easier as less responsability are upon you.
