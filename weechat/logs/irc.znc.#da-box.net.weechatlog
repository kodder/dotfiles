2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[10:27:30] Elventails: here here just closed my Facebook account 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[10:27:53] Never quite used it and I also hadn't accessed it in over two years
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[10:28:39] Decided it was better to close it especially in light of recent data sharing tos' they've been cooking up. Chiefly when it comes to whatsapp

2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[17:50:21] Tried following a few unreal engine groups now. But in general I can't stand fb 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[04:41:21] Kod: lol
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[04:41:47] Elventails: yeah never warmed up to it either.
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[08:28:09] samuraii: tough to warm up to it when they want all your life and they're breathing down your neck :P

2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[08:28:29] lol
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:43:42] Elventails: true! It always felt like too much exposure with very little consideration of any to privacy and identity protection 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:44:21] Btw doing some free aws labs. That shit is awesome 😃
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:45:35] My only qualm is correctly estimating costs. Seems every nook and cranny is paid for! Things can easily slip out of control if done hastily 😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:47:22] Cloudformation is awesome!
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:47:39] Kod: devop heaven 😃
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:52:29] First impression that is 😄
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:55:23] samuraii: eh akeed, still beats buying hardware constantly. you can autoscale everything.
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:56:30] Clickety click and what used to take hours is done automatically from a web page 😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:56:46] eh, works on aws cli as well
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:56:50] and some sdk
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:56:52] it helps too
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:57:07] Extra db loadbalancer compute instance cloud infra high performance computing 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:57:26] Yeah I did a lab on deploying a website app like
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:57:38] Upload zip and let it rip!
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:57:43] eh
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:57:43] Pardon the pun
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:57:46] 😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:58:09] Bas so far cloud formation is awesome 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:58:13] I am gonna setup some mechanism to deploy from jenkins and stuff upon git push
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:58:27] 👍
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:58:38] bass fee codedeploy that does this automatically too
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:58:40] Bas my only concern is running cost
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:58:49] Too many variables 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:58:58] aws is more targetted for comapnies, not single persons
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:59:08] for single persons it costs more
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:59:20] True
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:59:44] But somehow it also makes sense to have it accessible to individuals
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[08:59:54] The free tier I think works well enough
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[08:59:57] with ec2 nano instance it is pretty cheap
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:00:16] Bas after a year how to determine costs 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:00:22] irc, screen, some server access to the world, you dont need more for nano
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:00:23] Traffic certainly is a variable
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:00:32] that's why you autoscale for traffic
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:00:47] Yes I found it to be more than enough in terms of resources 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:00:50] also remember, ec2, rds and memcached
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:00:54] Very respectable 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:01:16] Eh my issue is with rds it's not free after the first year
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:01:28] The ec2 instance on the other hand is
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:01:32] you start with ec2, behind a load balancer  and ready to autoscale (db on ec2)
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:01:52] Eh no rds ec2 centric to start 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:01:56] autoscale, db on 1 ec2...
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:02:02] so that's a problem
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:02:11] It's pretty cool 😃
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:02:26] so if you start gaining traffic that warants autoscaling
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:02:30] you create rds
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:02:30] Yup then cost tracking becomes a little hairy
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:02:44] Exactly
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:02:44] not really, you can set limits, notifications, etc.
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:03:03] you get text to your phone
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:03:06] Bas 3am ne7keh> 100K request 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:03:17] sure
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:03:22] but it is not 100k constant
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:03:25] you autoscale
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:03:49] to warrant it yes
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:03:59] if you are not gonna autoscale
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:04:02] there is no point of aws
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:04:21] then you get a beefed up server and you pay for it monthly
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:04:23] Hence the not for individuals 😄
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:04:31] eh
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:04:48] Bas can you get it for free on aws hosting and all with a nano instance?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:04:56] Or only for first year
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:05:05] the fier tier is for a micro instance
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:05:21] the free tier doesn't cover everything
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:05:28] for example route53 is not covered
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:05:53] so free tier thing is just for people to fuck around and learn aws
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:06:27] I see so you can't really use it as a free staging server per we without running into costs
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:09:05] inno it's a business :P
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:09:21] bass inno route53 will cost you shee $1.50 per month
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:10:17] in my opinion aws is not worth it if you are going to have last than, load balancer + ec2 autoscale, rds , route53 as minimum
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:10:23] less*
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:10:45] unless of course you just want it for irc/screen usage, then a nano without anything else is more than enough
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:12:20] samuraii: didn't check the labs
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:12:35] samuraii: but the thing costs a  lot
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:12:52] price goes up really quick
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:14:27] Elventails: that's how I felt pricing is so finely grained it's impossible to get a good estimate 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:15:22] How about a managed aws business infrastructure. You outsource your it we take care of the scaling and provisioning 😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:15:23] samuraii: amazing system overall 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:15:35] Middle men for as long as we can wing it 😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:15:36] samuraii: price arguably worth it in a lot of cases / but not all
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:16:23] samuraii: nah - you'll always need someone responsible for something
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:16:35] Yeah! Need to dig into it some more to get a good feel and perspective 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:16:39] inno you can do your coffee but you still buy it
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:16:52] But damn fine infra
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:17:10] Elventails: true unless your gonna be growing your own tree😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:17:40] Once roasting is done its customer ready at every stage from there
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:17:50] inno - cafe younes :P
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:17:55] lol
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:17:57] Lol
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:18:11] Still going strong btw 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:18:18] All the rest have more or less dwindled
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:18:47] speaking of coffee I think I will get an espresso machine
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:18:48] :P
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:18:51] Bought some fine Jamaica blue mountain beans for my French press from there quite recently
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:18:59] cool
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:19:01] Eh do! 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:19:03] french press or nescafe just doesn't cut it anymore
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:19:22] If you want variety go for a nespresso 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:19:37] If you want something lasting go for an illy 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:20:09] will see, what I can get. I am not paying for it
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:20:12] I got airmiles
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:20:13] :P
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:20:17] If you want to be a espresso pro buy a La Marzocco 😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:20:30] Lol
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:21:12] Entry level nespresso "Pixie" should be available 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:24:36] nope ma fee
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:24:48] my best bet is a brevilkle duo-temp
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:24:52] breville
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:25:30] oh wait
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:25:37] found other nespressos
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:25:45] nespresso citiz
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:25:52] and nespresso vertuoline
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[09:26:33] nespresso 10 capsules saro bi 18,000LL
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[09:26:54] got them for 3 euros in paris 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:27:03] no clue how much here
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:27:54] 0.77 per unit
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:28:08] so 7.70 / 10
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:28:16] so cheaper than leb
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:28:21] this cad $
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:28:38] 9000 ll approx
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:29:14] Citiz is a nice machine
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:29:22] when I went to paris in october
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:29:31] I didn't find it expensive at all compared to Montreal
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:29:41] the only thing there that is more expensive is rent
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:29:47] ( a lot more expensive)
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:29:57] but food, clothes, shoes, etc... exact same prices as here
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:30:07] Leviathan: went three weeks ago it depends on the flavor you pick it's from 12K to 18K lbp 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:30:43] Kod and that depends on where you want to rent some places are cheaper even than Montreal 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:31:32] I went to north face (a canadian company), becuase I didn't bring the liner of my jacket with me
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:31:44] and it was way colder than I expected to be
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:31:47] (5 degrees)
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:32:11] and I went in expecting to be royally screwed, because euro/paris
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:32:33] nope, same prices after converting currency + taxes
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:32:42] so I though, hmm. let me go check some geox boots
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:32:45] same prices too
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:33:40] quality food is cheaper there
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:33:53] http://xkcd.com/1726/
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:33:56] cheese, wine, etc... much cheaper than montreal
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:34:04] *interlude*
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[09:34:07] MUCH cheaper
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:34:21] eh those commodities certainly are

2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution

2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not

2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-01 14:20:32	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[03:34:51] 😂
2016-09-01 14:20:32	samuraii	[03:35:06] My ec2 isn't working!

2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:57:43] Pardon the pun
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:57:46] 😂
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:58:09] Bas so far cloud formation is awesome 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[08:58:13] I am gonna setup some mechanism to deploy from jenkins and stuff upon git push
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:58:27] 👍
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[08:58:38] bass fee codedeploy that does this automatically too
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:58:40] Bas my only concern is running cost
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:58:49] Too many variables 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[08:58:58] aws is more targetted for comapnies, not single persons
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[08:59:08] for single persons it costs more
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:59:20] True
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:59:44] But somehow it also makes sense to have it accessible to individuals
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[08:59:54] The free tier I think works well enough
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[08:59:57] with ec2 nano instance it is pretty cheap
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:00:16] Bas after a year how to determine costs 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:00:22] irc, screen, some server access to the world, you dont need more for nano
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:00:23] Traffic certainly is a variable
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:00:32] that's why you autoscale for traffic
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:00:47] Yes I found it to be more than enough in terms of resources 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:00:50] also remember, ec2, rds and memcached
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:00:54] Very respectable 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:01:16] Eh my issue is with rds it's not free after the first year
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:01:28] The ec2 instance on the other hand is
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:01:32] you start with ec2, behind a load balancer  and ready to autoscale (db on ec2)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:01:52] Eh no rds ec2 centric to start 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:01:56] autoscale, db on 1 ec2...
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:02:02] so that's a problem
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:02:11] It's pretty cool 😃
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:02:26] so if you start gaining traffic that warants autoscaling
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:02:30] you create rds
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:02:30] Yup then cost tracking becomes a little hairy
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:02:44] Exactly
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:02:44] not really, you can set limits, notifications, etc.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:03:03] you get text to your phone
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:03:06] Bas 3am ne7keh> 100K request 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:03:17] sure
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:03:22] but it is not 100k constant
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:03:25] you autoscale
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:03:49] to warrant it yes
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:03:59] if you are not gonna autoscale
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:04:02] there is no point of aws
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:04:21] then you get a beefed up server and you pay for it monthly
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:04:23] Hence the not for individuals 😄
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:04:31] eh
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:04:48] Bas can you get it for free on aws hosting and all with a nano instance?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:04:56] Or only for first year
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:05:05] the fier tier is for a micro instance
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:05:21] the free tier doesn't cover everything
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:05:28] for example route53 is not covered
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:05:53] so free tier thing is just for people to fuck around and learn aws
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:06:27] I see so you can't really use it as a free staging server per we without running into costs
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:09:05] inno it's a business :P
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:09:21] bass inno route53 will cost you shee $1.50 per month
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:10:17] in my opinion aws is not worth it if you are going to have last than, load balancer + ec2 autoscale, rds , route53 as minimum
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:10:23] less*
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:10:45] unless of course you just want it for irc/screen usage, then a nano without anything else is more than enough
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:12:20] samuraii: didn't check the labs
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:12:35] samuraii: but the thing costs a  lot
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:12:52] price goes up really quick
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:14:27] Elventails: that's how I felt pricing is so finely grained it's impossible to get a good estimate 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:15:22] How about a managed aws business infrastructure. You outsource your it we take care of the scaling and provisioning 😂
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:15:23] samuraii: amazing system overall 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:15:35] Middle men for as long as we can wing it 😂
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:15:36] samuraii: price arguably worth it in a lot of cases / but not all
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:16:23] samuraii: nah - you'll always need someone responsible for something
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:16:35] Yeah! Need to dig into it some more to get a good feel and perspective 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:16:39] inno you can do your coffee but you still buy it
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:16:52] But damn fine infra
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:17:10] Elventails: true unless your gonna be growing your own tree😂
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:17:40] Once roasting is done its customer ready at every stage from there
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:17:50] inno - cafe younes :P
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:17:55] lol
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:17:57] Lol
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:18:11] Still going strong btw 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:18:18] All the rest have more or less dwindled
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:18:47] speaking of coffee I think I will get an espresso machine
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:18:48] :P
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:18:51] Bought some fine Jamaica blue mountain beans for my French press from there quite recently
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:18:59] cool
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:19:01] Eh do! 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:19:03] french press or nescafe just doesn't cut it anymore
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:19:22] If you want variety go for a nespresso 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:19:37] If you want something lasting go for an illy 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:20:09] will see, what I can get. I am not paying for it
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:20:12] I got airmiles
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:20:13] :P
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:20:17] If you want to be a espresso pro buy a La Marzocco 😂
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:20:30] Lol
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:21:12] Entry level nespresso "Pixie" should be available 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:24:36] nope ma fee
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:24:48] my best bet is a brevilkle duo-temp
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:24:52] breville
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:25:30] oh wait
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:25:37] found other nespressos

2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:25:52] and nespresso vertuoline
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[09:26:33] nespresso 10 capsules saro bi 18,000LL
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[09:26:54] got them for 3 euros in paris 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:27:03] no clue how much here
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:27:54] 0.77 per unit
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:28:08] so 7.70 / 10
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:28:16] so cheaper than leb
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:28:21] this cad $
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:28:38] 9000 ll approx
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:29:14] Citiz is a nice machine
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:29:22] when I went to paris in october
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:29:31] I didn't find it expensive at all compared to Montreal
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:29:41] the only thing there that is more expensive is rent
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:29:47] ( a lot more expensive)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:29:57] but food, clothes, shoes, etc... exact same prices as here
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:30:07] Leviathan: went three weeks ago it depends on the flavor you pick it's from 12K to 18K lbp 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:30:43] Kod and that depends on where you want to rent some places are cheaper even than Montreal 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:31:32] I went to north face (a canadian company), becuase I didn't bring the liner of my jacket with me
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:31:44] and it was way colder than I expected to be
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:31:47] (5 degrees)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:32:11] and I went in expecting to be royally screwed, because euro/paris
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:32:33] nope, same prices after converting currency + taxes
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:32:42] so I though, hmm. let me go check some geox boots
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:32:45] same prices too
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:33:40] quality food is cheaper there
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:33:53] http://xkcd.com/1726/
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:33:56] cheese, wine, etc... much cheaper than montreal
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:34:04] *interlude*
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:34:07] MUCH cheaper
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:34:21] eh those commodities certainly are
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:34:32] They produce them! 😃
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:34:39] eh
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:34:46] meat is same
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:34:51] chicken/beef/ etc
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:34:59] and they a lot more choices for everything
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:35:04] You should see the cost of food here
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:35:14] and european market is there, so lots of nice things
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:35:20] they don't arrive here...
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:35:23] It's like constantly eating caviar when all you get is a zwan box

2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:36:00] I think we need a new term to describe how far gone shit is here
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:36:02] people forgot about the trash, now it's coming back... wo balash el na2... oh really? it wasn't solved, you just accepted it and moved on.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:36:23] It was solved now suddenly they don't like the solution 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:36:37] Everyone has an opinion with no solution
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:36:42] lebanon should not exist anymore frankly
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:36:44] Very constructive
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:37:00] maybe it should have never got independence...
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:37:07] we would be french citizens
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[09:37:15] nice passport

2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[10:33:55] also - learning languages is a bitch
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[10:34:01] unless you're working with them day in day out 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[10:34:02] eh I know

2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[10:34:36] i.e. in python

2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[13:01:38] bubble sort, insert sort and shit like that

2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless

2016-09-02 14:13:21	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good

2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:04:31] eh
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:04:48] Bas can you get it for free on aws hosting and all with a nano instance?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:04:56] Or only for first year
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:05:05] the fier tier is for a micro instance
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:05:21] the free tier doesn't cover everything
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:05:28] for example route53 is not covered
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:05:53] so free tier thing is just for people to fuck around and learn aws
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:06:27] I see so you can't really use it as a free staging server per we without running into costs
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:09:05] inno it's a business :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:09:21] bass inno route53 will cost you shee $1.50 per month
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:10:17] in my opinion aws is not worth it if you are going to have last than, load balancer + ec2 autoscale, rds , route53 as minimum
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:10:23] less*
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:10:45] unless of course you just want it for irc/screen usage, then a nano without anything else is more than enough
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:12:20] samuraii: didn't check the labs
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:12:35] samuraii: but the thing costs a  lot
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:12:52] price goes up really quick
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:14:27] Elventails: that's how I felt pricing is so finely grained it's impossible to get a good estimate 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:15:22] How about a managed aws business infrastructure. You outsource your it we take care of the scaling and provisioning 😂
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:15:23] samuraii: amazing system overall 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:15:35] Middle men for as long as we can wing it 😂
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:15:36] samuraii: price arguably worth it in a lot of cases / but not all
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:16:23] samuraii: nah - you'll always need someone responsible for something
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:16:35] Yeah! Need to dig into it some more to get a good feel and perspective 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:16:39] inno you can do your coffee but you still buy it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:16:52] But damn fine infra
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:17:10] Elventails: true unless your gonna be growing your own tree😂
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:17:40] Once roasting is done its customer ready at every stage from there
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:17:50] inno - cafe younes :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:17:55] lol

2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:18:18] All the rest have more or less dwindled
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:18:47] speaking of coffee I think I will get an espresso machine
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:18:48] :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:18:51] Bought some fine Jamaica blue mountain beans for my French press from there quite recently
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:18:59] cool
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:19:01] Eh do! 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:19:03] french press or nescafe just doesn't cut it anymore
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:19:22] If you want variety go for a nespresso 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:19:37] If you want something lasting go for an illy 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:20:09] will see, what I can get. I am not paying for it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:20:12] I got airmiles
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:20:13] :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:20:17] If you want to be a espresso pro buy a La Marzocco 😂
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:20:30] Lol
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:21:12] Entry level nespresso "Pixie" should be available 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:24:36] nope ma fee

2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:24:52] breville

2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:29:22] when I went to paris in october
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:29:31] I didn't find it expensive at all compared to Montreal
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:29:41] the only thing there that is more expensive is rent
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:29:47] ( a lot more expensive)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:29:57] but food, clothes, shoes, etc... exact same prices as here
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:30:07] Leviathan: went three weeks ago it depends on the flavor you pick it's from 12K to 18K lbp 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:30:43] Kod and that depends on where you want to rent some places are cheaper even than Montreal 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:31:32] I went to north face (a canadian company), becuase I didn't bring the liner of my jacket with me
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:31:44] and it was way colder than I expected to be
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:31:47] (5 degrees)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:32:11] and I went in expecting to be royally screwed, because euro/paris
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:32:33] nope, same prices after converting currency + taxes
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:32:42] so I though, hmm. let me go check some geox boots
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:32:45] same prices too
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:33:40] quality food is cheaper there
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:33:53] http://xkcd.com/1726/
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:33:56] cheese, wine, etc... much cheaper than montreal
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:34:04] *interlude*
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:34:07] MUCH cheaper
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:34:21] eh those commodities certainly are
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:34:32] They produce them! 😃

2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:35:04] You should see the cost of food here
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:35:14] and european market is there, so lots of nice things
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:35:20] they don't arrive here...

2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:36:23] It was solved now suddenly they don't like the solution 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:36:37] Everyone has an opinion with no solution
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:36:42] lebanon should not exist anymore frankly
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:36:44] Very constructive
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[09:37:00] maybe it should have never got independence...

2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[10:34:46] i.e. bee3 learn language to get job in that
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[10:34:48] it should have some advantages I don't know about if tons of devops jobs want it.

2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[13:01:06] I haven't done those type of questions since uni
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[13:01:38] bubble sort, insert sort and shit like that
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[13:01:44] I use a library, end of story.

2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[13:01:54] aslan they're basic
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[13:40:25] keef el shabeb?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:21:02] I just switched to weechat, a bit nicer looking than irssi
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus!
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:19:31] server + screen + weechat+ glowing bear = fireblade can come here from work...
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:19:38] http://www.glowing-bear.org/
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[16:35:55] Glowing bear 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:40:19] eh :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:40:29] bass inno weechat supports tons of shit that irssi doesn't
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:40:32] even http proxies
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:40:47] if there is a will there is away
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:40:50] a way
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:41:15] and it's just a command, /relay add , /proxy add
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:41:25] very easy setup
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:42:50] http://quassel-irc.org/
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[16:43:24] elventails: seems we can get rid of znc even man

2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[21:52:21] Too bad. Africa was going to have faster pr0n access. 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[22:25:27] yep, africa's internet is their top priority...
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[22:25:41] :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[22:25:54] majnoon zuckerberg :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[09:12:30] checked screenshots - looks interesting
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[10:54:54] hmm
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:22:51] need primepie to talk to see his nick colour 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:23:00] samuraii and elventails are both blue
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:32:50] Primepie is yellow on my end
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:33:07] Elventails: purple
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:33:16] Kod: blue
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:33:32] Leviathan: green

2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:34:06] a small not annoying beep from weechat
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:34:16] the terminal beep
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:34:57] try it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:34:59] annoy me a bit
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:35:10] Hahahaha
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:35:20] Let's see

2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:35:46] :P
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:35:48] Hahahahha
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:35:58] Like you didn't see it coming 😂
2016-09-03 12:26:25	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-03 12:26:25	Kod	[15:09:36] irssi has similar confs
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-03 12:26:25	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use
2016-09-03 12:26:25	elventails	[16:41:57] leviathan: wou ayr

2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[12:50:33] https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[12:58:04] eh - bass iza it works - they connect you with good companies
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[12:59:33] yep
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:00:00] I would fail on step2, algorithms . so need to prepare before going through it.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[13:00:33] no way - they have that too
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[13:00:34] oof
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:00:57] yeah
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:01:06] I haven't done those type of questions since uni
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:01:38] bubble sort, insert sort and shit like that
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:01:44] I use a library, end of story.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[13:01:48] inno its fine
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[13:01:54] aslan they're basic
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[03:34:17] Kod: great news re the cert 😃
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[03:34:46] Leviathan: if it's broke generate a new instance. The new way of turning it off and on again.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[03:34:51] 😂
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[03:35:06] My ec2 isn't working!

2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:21:02] I just switched to weechat, a bit nicer looking than irssi
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus!
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:19:31] server + screen + weechat+ glowing bear = fireblade can come here from work...
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[15:19:38] http://www.glowing-bear.org/

2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[16:40:29] bass inno weechat supports tons of shit that irssi doesn't
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[16:40:32] even http proxies
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[16:40:47] if there is a will there is away

2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?

2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[10:54:54] hmm
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-04 12:32:20	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:22:51] need primepie to talk to see his nick colour 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:23:00] samuraii and elventails are both blue

2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:34:57] try it
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:34:59] annoy me a bit

2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[14:35:58] Like you didn't see it coming 😂
2016-09-04 12:32:20	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-04 12:32:20	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-04 12:32:20	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[09:29:41] the only thing there that is more expensive is rent
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[09:29:47] ( a lot more expensive)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[09:29:57] but food, clothes, shoes, etc... exact same prices as here

2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static

2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-05 21:58:39	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-05 21:58:39	elventails	[09:53:35] :)

2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless

2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-05 21:58:39	elventails	[09:12:20] lol

2016-09-05 21:58:39	elventails	[10:54:54] hmm
2016-09-05 21:58:39	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P

2016-09-05 21:58:39	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-05 21:58:39	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.

2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:34:57] try it

2016-09-05 21:58:39	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-05 21:58:39	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[13:01:06] I haven't done those type of questions since uni
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.

2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:06:14] year

2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:21:02] I just switched to weechat, a bit nicer looking than irssi
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus!
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:19:31] server + screen + weechat+ glowing bear = fireblade can come here from work...
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[15:19:38] http://www.glowing-bear.org/

2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[16:40:29] bass inno weechat supports tons of shit that irssi doesn't
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[16:40:32] even http proxies
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[16:40:47] if there is a will there is away

2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?

2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:22:51] need primepie to talk to see his nick colour 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:23:00] samuraii and elventails are both blue

2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:34:57] try it

2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-06 11:21:09	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-06 11:21:09	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-06 11:21:09	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-06 11:21:09	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[12:50:33] https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent

2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[12:59:33] yep
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:00:00] I would fail on step2, algorithms . so need to prepare before going through it.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[13:00:33] no way - they have that too
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[13:00:34] oof
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:00:57] yeah
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:01:06] I haven't done those type of questions since uni
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:01:38] bubble sort, insert sort and shit like that
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:01:44] I use a library, end of story.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[13:01:48] inno its fine
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[13:01:54] aslan they're basic
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[03:34:17] Kod: great news re the cert 😃
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[03:34:46] Leviathan: if it's broke generate a new instance. The new way of turning it off and on again.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[03:34:51] 😂
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[03:35:06] My ec2 isn't working!

2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:21:02] I just switched to weechat, a bit nicer looking than irssi
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus!
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:19:31] server + screen + weechat+ glowing bear = fireblade can come here from work...
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[15:19:38] http://www.glowing-bear.org/
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[16:35:55] Glowing bear 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[16:40:19] eh :P
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[16:40:29] bass inno weechat supports tons of shit that irssi doesn't
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[16:40:32] even http proxies
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[16:40:47] if there is a will there is away

2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[16:41:15] and it's just a command, /relay add , /proxy add
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[16:41:25] very easy setup
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[16:42:50] http://quassel-irc.org/

2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[09:12:30] checked screenshots - looks interesting
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[10:54:54] hmm
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:22:51] need primepie to talk to see his nick colour 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:23:00] samuraii and elventails are both blue

2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:34:16] the terminal beep
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:34:57] try it
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:34:59] annoy me a bit

2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[14:35:58] Like you didn't see it coming 😂
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-06 13:56:54	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-06 13:56:54	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved

2016-09-06 13:56:54	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"

2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[03:34:51] 😂

2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[15:19:31] server + screen + weechat+ glowing bear = fireblade can come here from work...

2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[09:12:30] checked screenshots - looks interesting
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[10:54:54] hmm
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:22:51] need primepie to talk to see his nick colour

2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:34:57] try it

2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-06 14:03:23	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-06 14:03:23	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-06 14:03:23	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-06 14:03:23	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"

2016-09-06 15:16:06	Kod	but if the rumours are true, I am not happy with the removal of the headphones jack
2016-09-06 15:16:14	elventails	and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-06 15:16:17	Kod	I would have some adaptor.

2016-09-06 15:17:40	Kod	have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-06 15:18:01	Kod	I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones

2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[12:59:33] yep
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:00:00] I would fail on step2, algorithms . so need to prepare before going through it.
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[13:00:33] no way - they have that too
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[13:00:34] oof
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:00:57] yeah
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:01:06] I haven't done those type of questions since uni
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:01:38] bubble sort, insert sort and shit like that
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:01:44] I use a library, end of story.
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[13:01:48] inno its fine
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[13:01:54] aslan they're basic
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage

2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not

2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[09:53:35] :)

2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[03:34:51] 😂
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[03:35:06] My ec2 isn't working!

2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless

2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂

2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.

2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:34:57] try it

2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[08:53:24] Message was garbled first time and sent by mistake a second time
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[08:53:45] blame autocorrect 
2016-09-06 20:32:50	samuraii	[08:53:53] Always 😂
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-06 20:32:50	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:15:39] no clue
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[15:15:47] I think so
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[15:15:59] samsung fucked up big time with their phone release :P
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:16:06] but if the rumours are true, I am not happy with the removal of the headphones jack
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:16:24] + to buy

2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:17:40] have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-06 20:32:50	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[15:48:54] interesting to see
2016-09-06 20:32:50	elventails	[15:49:00] apple has been on a steady "we suck" streak

2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[12:59:33] yep
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:00:00] I would fail on step2, algorithms . so need to prepare before going through it.
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[13:00:33] no way - they have that too
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[13:00:34] oof
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:00:57] yeah
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:01:06] I haven't done those type of questions since uni
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:01:38] bubble sort, insert sort and shit like that
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:01:44] I use a library, end of story.
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[13:01:48] inno its fine
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[13:01:54] aslan they're basic
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂

2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless

2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂

2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.

2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-06 20:42:22	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-06 20:42:22	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"

2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:15:39] no clue
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[15:15:47] I think so
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[15:15:59] samsung fucked up big time with their phone release :P
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:16:06] but if the rumours are true, I am not happy with the removal of the headphones jack
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:16:24] + to buy
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[15:16:25] I don't think anyone is afaik

2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:17:18] and earphones when I am on the go
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:17:40] have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-06 20:42:22	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[15:48:54] interesting to see
2016-09-06 20:42:22	elventails	[15:49:00] apple has been on a steady "we suck" streak

2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[12:50:33] https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[12:58:04] eh - bass iza it works - they connect you with good companies
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[12:59:33] yep
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:00:00] I would fail on step2, algorithms . so need to prepare before going through it.
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[13:00:33] no way - they have that too
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[13:00:34] oof
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:00:57] yeah
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:01:06] I haven't done those type of questions since uni
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:01:38] bubble sort, insert sort and shit like that
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:01:44] I use a library, end of story.
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[13:01:48] inno its fine
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[13:01:54] aslan they're basic
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:21:02] I just switched to weechat, a bit nicer looking than irssi
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus!
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:19:31] server + screen + weechat+ glowing bear = fireblade can come here from work...
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[15:19:38] http://www.glowing-bear.org/

2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[16:40:19] eh :P
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[16:40:29] bass inno weechat supports tons of shit that irssi doesn't
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[16:40:32] even http proxies
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[16:40:47] if there is a will there is away
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[16:40:50] a way
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[16:41:15] and it's just a command, /relay add , /proxy add
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[16:41:25] very easy setup
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[16:42:50] http://quassel-irc.org/

2016-09-06 20:43:26	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?

2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-06 20:43:26	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-06 20:43:26	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:22:51] need primepie to talk to see his nick colour 
2016-09-06 20:43:26	Kod	[14:23:00] samuraii and elventails are both blue

2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[14:34:16] the terminal beep
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[14:34:57] try it
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[14:34:59] annoy me a bit

2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[14:35:58] Like you didn't see it coming 😂
2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-06 20:43:27	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-06 20:43:27	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-06 20:43:27	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-06 20:43:27	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[08:52:46] Mascons one is correct for an old shoot'm up its still quite entertaining
2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[08:53:24] Message was garbled first time and sent by mistake a second time

2016-09-06 20:43:27	samuraii	[08:53:53] Always 😂
2016-09-06 20:43:27	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-06 20:43:27	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[15:15:32] in other news
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[15:15:35] iphone 7 this week?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[15:15:39] no clue
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[15:15:47] I think so
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[15:15:59] samsung fucked up big time with their phone release :P
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[15:16:06] but if the rumours are true, I am not happy with the removal of the headphones jack
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[15:16:24] + to buy
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[15:16:25] I don't think anyone is afaik
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[15:16:57] I have 2 bose headphones that I use for pc, mac and iphone
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[15:17:18] and earphones when I am on the go
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[15:17:40] have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[15:48:54] interesting to see
2016-09-06 20:43:27	elventails	[15:49:00] apple has been on a steady "we suck" streak

2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[12:59:33] yep
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:00:00] I would fail on step2, algorithms . so need to prepare before going through it.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[13:00:33] no way - they have that too
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[13:00:34] oof
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:00:57] yeah
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:01:06] I haven't done those type of questions since uni
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:01:20] one interviewer a few months ago asked me stuff like that.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:01:28] I told him, I don't remember any of this.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:01:38] bubble sort, insert sort and shit like that
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:01:44] I use a library, end of story.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[13:01:48] inno its fine
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[13:01:54] aslan they're basic
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[13:01:57] and if in python - even simpler
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[13:17:40] seriously, when's the last time anyone had to manually implement a sorting algorithm?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:34:04] leviathan: you just do it in uni, never ever had to do it in "real life"
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[13:34:45] I think people who interview these stuff for other than fresh grads are places I don't want to work in...
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:51:26] samuraii: forgot to mention something , if your website is static/client facing you can host it on s3. no need for ec2 all together...
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[14:53:50] might be a good idea to try
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[14:54:02] make the CMS only hosted on the actual server 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[14:54:07] and that server be a very small server
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[14:54:16] and generate static HTML and put on S3
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:54:22] yeah everything frontend can be done there, rest api shit to the back end on ec2 which points to rds
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:54:30] everything nano/micro
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[14:55:00] best if also the website doesn't need any backend support
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[14:55:04] all static 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:55:05] eh
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:55:10] it's peanuts on s3
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:55:35] if you have several static websites you maintain, real peanuts
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[14:55:42] and can automatically handle high traffic if you happen to get it
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:55:48] yeah
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:56:03] proper worldwide distribution
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:56:30] Standard Storage	Standard - Infrequent Access Storage †	Glacier Storage
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:56:54] https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:56:57] super cheap
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[14:57:10] problem is, most sites will still require a backen d
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:57:10] inno static sites, won't be above 1GB no way in hell
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:57:19] eh it's fine
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:57:30] you then do rest api to backend
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:57:36] javascript/jquery what ever
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:57:41] no need to host them on ec2
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:02:39] I host these sites on shared VPSes
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:02:51] and live in the constant fear that someday, one of these sites will get famous
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:03:03] lol
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:03:45] lately I'm hosting all assets on S3
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:03:56] you can utilise some marketting shit 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:03:57] client uploaded images, stylesheets, js, etc..
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:04:13] frees up the bandwidth for other things
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:05:18] eh
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:05:21] and give them impossible choices 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:05:24] lol
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:06:14] year
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:06:16] okie
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:06:23] it;s good value actually
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:06:33] I don't put limits on it
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[15:07:00] no one uses up more than 5-6Gb 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:07:27] of course not
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[08:25:10] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Scq2GJJD6cA&feature=youtu.be
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[09:53:35] :)
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[11:29:08] so what would cause an ec2 node to stop pulling updates?

2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[03:34:17] Kod: great news re the cert 😃
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[03:34:46] Leviathan: if it's broke generate a new instance. The new way of turning it off and on again.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[03:34:51] 😂
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[03:35:06] My ec2 isn't working!

2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:21:02] I just switched to weechat, a bit nicer looking than irssi
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus!
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:19:31] server + screen + weechat+ glowing bear = fireblade can come here from work...
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:19:38] http://www.glowing-bear.org/

2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[16:40:29] bass inno weechat supports tons of shit that irssi doesn't
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[16:40:32] even http proxies
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[16:40:47] if there is a will there is away

2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?

2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:22:51] need primepie to talk to see his nick colour 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:23:00] samuraii and elventails are both blue

2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:34:57] try it

2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[14:35:58] Like you didn't see it coming 😂
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[21:59:28] hiking for 4 hours, then kayaking for an hour.

2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[21:59:43] probably because of kayaking more than hiking

2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[04:18:43] Bye duke nukem is due for re-release
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[08:50:40] *woman

2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[08:52:46] Mascons one is correct for an old shoot'm up its still quite entertaining
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[08:53:24] Message was garbled first time and sent by mistake a second time
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[08:53:45] blame autocorrect 
2016-09-07 02:15:21	samuraii	[08:53:53] Always 😂
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-07 02:15:21	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:16:24] + to buy
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[15:16:25] I don't think anyone is afaik
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:16:57] I have 2 bose headphones that I use for pc, mac and iphone
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:17:18] and earphones when I am on the go
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:17:40] have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-07 02:15:21	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[15:48:54] interesting to see
2016-09-07 02:15:21	elventails	[15:49:00] apple has been on a steady "we suck" streak

2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:02:59] and bring down the whole server with it :P

2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:04:41] and makes sites load much faster, when you slap on cloudfront 
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[15:04:47] tell them you have multiple hosting options: economy, premium, premium plus etc...
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:05:06] I do that
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:05:13] but in all cases I put the shit on S3

2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?

2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂

2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:21:02] I just switched to weechat, a bit nicer looking than irssi
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus!
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:30:22] needs a bit of customization though
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[15:19:31] server + screen + weechat+ glowing bear = fireblade can come here from work...
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[15:19:38] http://www.glowing-bear.org/
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[16:35:55] Glowing bear 
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[16:40:19] eh :P
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[16:40:29] bass inno weechat supports tons of shit that irssi doesn't
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[16:40:32] even http proxies
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[16:40:47] if there is a will there is away

2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[16:41:15] and it's just a command, /relay add , /proxy add
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[16:41:25] very easy setup
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[16:42:50] http://quassel-irc.org/

2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[09:12:30] checked screenshots - looks interesting
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[10:54:54] hmm
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:22:51] need primepie to talk to see his nick colour 
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:23:00] samuraii and elventails are both blue

2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:34:16] the terminal beep
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:34:57] try it
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:34:59] annoy me a bit

2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[14:35:58] Like you didn't see it coming 😂
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-07 09:43:19	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved

2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-07 09:43:19	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-07 09:43:19	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.

2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[15:05:44] for example
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[15:05:55] used to be $100 for hosting plan
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[15:05:58] changed to: 
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[15:06:06] economy plan: $200, premium plan: $250
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[15:06:10] they always take the premium 
2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[15:06:11] per month?
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[15:06:14] year

2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[15:06:35] hosting + admin for $250 / year
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[15:06:39] sell it as unlimited 
2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[15:06:41] ya balehs

2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[09:53:35] :)

2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[03:34:46] Leviathan: if it's broke generate a new instance. The new way of turning it off and on again.
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[03:34:51] 😂
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[03:35:06] My ec2 isn't working!

2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[09:12:20] lol
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[09:12:24] Kod: kee hal weechat?
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[09:12:30] checked screenshots - looks interesting
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[10:54:54] hmm
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[10:54:59] looks like the gtx arrived earlier :P
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[10:55:01] unboxing time
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[11:29:55] salbeh - its pretty small
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.

2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream

2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-07 17:22:10	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[16:09:22] so I spend 2 days getting a 2-bit dithered video filter working, and when it finally comes up with good results, I have no way to export it
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-07 17:22:10	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-07 17:22:10	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-07 17:22:10	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"

2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:14:53] Elventails: mnee7a! Sounds exactly like Lebanese politicians 
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:14:57] 😂😂😂
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:17:43] Btw was checking the Amazon monthly calculator and they have a free website plan which includes ec2 s3 rds Dynamo elasticache cloudwatch ses sns sqs swf respectable in out transfer and basic support
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:18:10] But it's not clear if it's just for the first year or for as long as it's running
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:18:50] It's actual cost is $86.64 but discounted as free tier
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:18:57] So I guess only the first year
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:19:05] That's monthly btw
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:19:28] Certainly expensive for an individual!
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[09:19:52] I like the "free" catch phrase though 😂
2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[09:53:35] :)

2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[03:34:51] 😂
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[03:35:06] My ec2 isn't working!

2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[14:30:34] there is some info overloading that is kinda useless

2016-09-07 21:02:38	leviathan	[02:04:42] < Kod> [21:22:28] extensions written in python instead of perl, that's a plus! <--- why is that a plus? how much does the extension language affect your daily usage?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[02:26:44] Leviathan: wallaw it's Kod he'll choose a python any day over a perl ba3dein as far as extensions go it's a no brainer taweel walla no2ta? 😂

2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[11:29:59] (that's what she said)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[11:30:27] almost same form factor as the gtx 650ti I had (which served me well)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[13:01:31] Elventails: as long as it's not "a" perl it's all good
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[13:59:17] It would interesting to know how it benchmarks on the VR game you cooked up 
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[14:19:47] leviathan: correction, extensions can be written in python. so if I want to extend something I can, because perl is hell...
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[14:19:53] elventails: really like it.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[14:20:40] elventails: basic stuff, is almost like irssi, kinda same feel. but it is much more powerful if you want to do distributed stuff like we do.

2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream

2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-07 21:02:38	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-07 21:02:38	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-07 21:02:38	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-07 21:02:38	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-07 21:02:38	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[15:16:06] but if the rumours are true, I am not happy with the removal of the headphones jack
2016-09-07 21:02:38	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.

2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[15:17:40] have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-07 21:02:38	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones

2016-09-08 10:38:49	Kod	[14:34:31] I should be able to customise it
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[14:34:45] It may get annoying if you get a stream 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Kod	[14:34:57] try it

2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[14:37:01] I think it can substitute it with a line highlighter when your nick is in it
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Kod	[14:38:24] there is a highlighter
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Kod	[14:38:48] but I can customise the beep and replace it with a command, what ever I want.

2016-09-08 10:38:49	leviathan	[16:09:41] video compression kills the exported video no matter how high the settings I use

2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-08 10:38:49	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-08 10:38:49	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-08 10:38:49	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-08 10:38:49	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.

2016-09-08 10:38:49	Kod	[15:17:40] have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones

2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:20:59] Also most annoying voice ever Johnny Ive who gets exited at the slightest curve in anything he touches. I think he gets wet dreams involving bezels ceramic and aluminum! 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:21:35] Fucking hate it when a designer mouths off like its the best thing to happen since sliced bread
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:22:50] Such egomaniacal tendencies when wallowing in the same product loop cannot be forgiven 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:30:34] https://www.fastcodesign.com/3063532/has-jonathan-ive-designed-himself-out-of-existence
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:32:00] And that was my impression before reading the article above. I guess a lot of people seem to share that opinion
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:37:56] samuraii: total ijree fiyon
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:38:02] samuraii: I mean totally agree
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:41:46] No they deserve it for iterating all these years rather than leading innovation
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:42:39] Steve Jobs was not only into design he was into customer experience which directly influenced design. This guy is into design shoved down the user's throat
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:43:23] I totally think there's a problem of innovation at Apple partly out of fear and partly out of design "masturbation". Apt enough description
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:46:19] samuraii: man - they don't need to design - they're not being challenged
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:46:28] samuraii: they can shelve any innovation and leave it for later..
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:46:38] samuraii: competition phones are blowing up by themselves
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:46:44] samuraii: they're cruising
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:46:56] True with the latest note 7 fiasco
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:47:20] But still they were considered market innovators not because they were challenged from outside 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:47:45] Because they were challenged from within by a charismatic CEO 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:47:50] samuraii: do you ever use market research reports?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:48:04] Tom Cook is good and all but hardly inspiring
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:48:11] Sometimes yes
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:48:18] any specific source?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:49:22] No usually it depends on the market segment I'm looking into
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:49:50] I would find which consulting group is the most influential and use their market research as a cornerstone
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:50:21] Sometimes I find the reference in a related article or press releases where they mention the study they get their numbers from
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:50:35] Anything I particular you need?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:50:39] nah just wondering
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:50:43] (thanks good ideas)
2016-09-08 10:38:49	leviathan	[08:50:47] Tom Cook is Tim Cook's macho twin brother?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:50:56] maybe curious about gartner reports - but clearly they cost a bazillion
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:51:05] Tom before he turned gay
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:51:09] its his male name
2016-09-08 10:38:49	leviathan	[08:51:10] lol
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:51:13] Loo
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:51:15] Lol
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:51:35] Gartner is good but high level not worth the money
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:52:02] The lat at one I'm looking into is from mandiant consulting m-trends 2016
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:52:37] Leviathan: using your advice! Bloody autocorrect ☠
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:53:08] samuraii: security specific?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:53:31] Yes state of breaches across the industry
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:53:33] ☠
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:53:35] cool
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:54:29] I usually find that going through McKenzie reports often lands me on some good sources they base their analysis on 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:55:17] eh 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:55:20] Often times they do an excellent job summarizing the market reports themselves 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:55:30] I see what you mean
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:55:38] I'd love to access gartner to see what its like
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:55:47] but iirc - it costs an arm and a leg
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:56:04] If it's industry specific it should cost less 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:56:18] If you want broad access then perhaps it will be steep
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:56:37] cool thanks - will check / been wondering about this for some time but not getting the chance to check
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:57:51] I usually get their summaries 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[08:58:32] Also check out "the information" good insight and costs less
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[08:58:52] hadn't heard of it - thanks will check
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:00:36] Ur welcome!
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:01:13] I'm not a robot

2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:01:45] What was the question? Road signs, lakes ...

2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:02:10] I don't even want their monthly reports
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:02:17] I want to be able to search through the db...

2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:03:41] booting up / have to get some code out of the way
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:03:42] Check out the information they have something similar in nature
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:03:52] will check - didn't like their sign-up form
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:04:03] 1st page (give email/etc..) hit next - they prompt you with prices/card info
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:04:04] 😄
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:04:14] so stopped there and will unsubscribe from their spam
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:04:20] can't stand these insulting tactics lol
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:04:39] so yeah - because of the UI I bucket "the information" in "ayre fiyon" lol
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:04:47] Yep! Well it's pretty standard across these types
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:05:00] Also check gigaom it's back on its feet

2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:09:35] what do you guys use that for again?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:09:48] Problem is finding a good omnichannel provider so as not to have mayhem and confusion!
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:10:11] Not using it yet! Tease arching use cases to propose to upper management 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:10:23] Looking into

2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:13:43] palaver?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:13:45] Palaver but the keyboard is the standard obe
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:13:50] One
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:14:08] Swiftkey ain't so hot on iOS 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:14:23] I used extensively on my old android
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:14:57] Somehow I feel the iPhone keyboard is made for small hands
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:16:09] Ps4 pro is out
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:16:30] Can't play 4K blue ray discs wtf!!
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:17:16] Yes we have a new console 4K everything except you can't play 4K blu Ray discs. We thought it would be cool
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:17:19] Geez 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:18:09] They should call it ps4 pro 2illa
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:24:21] samuraii: did they price their VR headset?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:24:48] Lemme check
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:26:06] 349£
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:26:21] October 13
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:26:31] U.K. Release 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:27:14] that's the ps4 pro
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:27:16] or the vr headset?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:27:20] VR 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:27:27] salbeh
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:27:31] Strangely close dates though
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:27:33] so vr alone is 349?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:27:40] Ps4 pro is in November 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:27:53] they didn't bundle it /etc..
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:27:58] 3 weeks after 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:28:04] Doesn't seem so
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:28:42] But they just might however pricing of the bundle puts it at a disadvantage to the new xbox 
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:28:58] I think they won't sell them together for marketing reasons
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:29:03] Drives down sales
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:29:27] so around $600 CAD for the headset
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:29:36] and another $600-$700 CAD or the machine
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:29:47] They've already confused people with a ps4 slim and this
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:29:54] they should release the headset 3a xmas...
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:29:54] Pretty much
2016-09-08 10:38:49	samuraii	[09:30:21] It would have made more sense since the hardware to drive it proper will be out almost a month after
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:58:36] samuraii: got a desktop nearby?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	elventails	[09:58:50] samuraii: with a camera + earphones

2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-08 16:12:36	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-08 16:12:36	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-08 16:12:36	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-08 16:12:36	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[15:15:47] I think so
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[15:15:59] samsung fucked up big time with their phone release :P
2016-09-08 16:12:36	Kod	[15:16:06] but if the rumours are true, I am not happy with the removal of the headphones jack
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-08 16:12:36	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	Kod	[15:16:24] + to buy

2016-09-08 16:12:36	Kod	[15:17:40] have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-08 16:12:36	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones

2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:19:02] I think one can safely say it's the most boring product unveiling in a long time! Getting excited over bloody headphones! Geez
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:20:59] Also most annoying voice ever Johnny Ive who gets exited at the slightest curve in anything he touches. I think he gets wet dreams involving bezels ceramic and aluminum! 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:21:35] Fucking hate it when a designer mouths off like its the best thing to happen since sliced bread
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:22:50] Such egomaniacal tendencies when wallowing in the same product loop cannot be forgiven 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:30:34] https://www.fastcodesign.com/3063532/has-jonathan-ive-designed-himself-out-of-existence
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:32:00] And that was my impression before reading the article above. I guess a lot of people seem to share that opinion
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:37:56] samuraii: total ijree fiyon
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:38:02] samuraii: I mean totally agree
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:41:46] No they deserve it for iterating all these years rather than leading innovation
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:42:39] Steve Jobs was not only into design he was into customer experience which directly influenced design. This guy is into design shoved down the user's throat
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:43:23] I totally think there's a problem of innovation at Apple partly out of fear and partly out of design "masturbation". Apt enough description
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:46:19] samuraii: man - they don't need to design - they're not being challenged
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:46:28] samuraii: they can shelve any innovation and leave it for later..
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:46:38] samuraii: competition phones are blowing up by themselves
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:46:44] samuraii: they're cruising
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:46:56] True with the latest note 7 fiasco
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:47:20] But still they were considered market innovators not because they were challenged from outside 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:47:45] Because they were challenged from within by a charismatic CEO 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:47:50] samuraii: do you ever use market research reports?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:48:04] Tom Cook is good and all but hardly inspiring
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:48:11] Sometimes yes
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:48:18] any specific source?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:49:22] No usually it depends on the market segment I'm looking into
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:49:50] I would find which consulting group is the most influential and use their market research as a cornerstone
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:50:21] Sometimes I find the reference in a related article or press releases where they mention the study they get their numbers from
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:50:35] Anything I particular you need?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:50:39] nah just wondering
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:50:43] (thanks good ideas)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	leviathan	[08:50:47] Tom Cook is Tim Cook's macho twin brother?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:50:56] maybe curious about gartner reports - but clearly they cost a bazillion
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:51:05] Tom before he turned gay
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:51:09] its his male name
2016-09-08 16:12:36	leviathan	[08:51:10] lol
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:51:13] Loo

2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:51:35] Gartner is good but high level not worth the money
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:52:02] The lat at one I'm looking into is from mandiant consulting m-trends 2016
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:52:37] Leviathan: using your advice! Bloody autocorrect ☠
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:53:08] samuraii: security specific?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:53:31] Yes state of breaches across the industry
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:53:33] ☠
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:53:35] cool
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:54:29] I usually find that going through McKenzie reports often lands me on some good sources they base their analysis on 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:55:17] eh 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:55:20] Often times they do an excellent job summarizing the market reports themselves 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:55:30] I see what you mean
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:55:38] I'd love to access gartner to see what its like
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:55:47] but iirc - it costs an arm and a leg
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:56:04] If it's industry specific it should cost less 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:56:18] If you want broad access then perhaps it will be steep
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:56:37] cool thanks - will check / been wondering about this for some time but not getting the chance to check
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:57:51] I usually get their summaries 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[08:58:32] Also check out "the information" good insight and costs less
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[08:58:52] hadn't heard of it - thanks will check
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:00:36] Ur welcome!

2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:03:52] will check - didn't like their sign-up form
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:04:03] 1st page (give email/etc..) hit next - they prompt you with prices/card info
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:04:04] 😄
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:04:14] so stopped there and will unsubscribe from their spam
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:04:20] can't stand these insulting tactics lol
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:04:39] so yeah - because of the UI I bucket "the information" in "ayre fiyon" lol
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:04:47] Yep! Well it's pretty standard across these types

2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:13:50] One
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:14:08] Swiftkey ain't so hot on iOS 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:14:23] I used extensively on my old android
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:14:57] Somehow I feel the iPhone keyboard is made for small hands
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:16:09] Ps4 pro is out
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:16:30] Can't play 4K blue ray discs wtf!!
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:17:16] Yes we have a new console 4K everything except you can't play 4K blu Ray discs. We thought it would be cool
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:17:19] Geez 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:18:09] They should call it ps4 pro 2illa
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:24:21] samuraii: did they price their VR headset?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:24:48] Lemme check
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:26:06] 349£
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:26:21] October 13
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:26:31] U.K. Release 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:27:14] that's the ps4 pro
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:27:16] or the vr headset?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:27:20] VR 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:27:27] salbeh
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:27:31] Strangely close dates though
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:27:33] so vr alone is 349?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:27:40] Ps4 pro is in November 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:27:53] they didn't bundle it /etc..
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:27:58] 3 weeks after 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:28:04] Doesn't seem so
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:28:42] But they just might however pricing of the bundle puts it at a disadvantage to the new xbox 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:28:58] I think they won't sell them together for marketing reasons
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:29:03] Drives down sales
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:29:27] so around $600 CAD for the headset
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:29:36] and another $600-$700 CAD or the machine
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:29:47] They've already confused people with a ps4 slim and this
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:29:54] they should release the headset 3a xmas...
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:29:54] Pretty much
2016-09-08 16:12:36	samuraii	[09:30:21] It would have made more sense since the hardware to drive it proper will be out almost a month after
2016-09-08 16:12:36	elventails	[09:58:36] samuraii: got a desktop nearby?

2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:53:24] Message was garbled first time and sent by mistake a second time

2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:53:53] Always 😂
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[15:15:39] no clue
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[15:15:47] I think so
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[15:15:59] samsung fucked up big time with their phone release :P
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[15:16:06] but if the rumours are true, I am not happy with the removal of the headphones jack
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[15:16:24] + to buy
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[15:16:25] I don't think anyone is afaik

2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[15:17:18] and earphones when I am on the go
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[15:17:40] have an extra adaptor would be weird...
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[15:48:54] interesting to see
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[15:49:00] apple has been on a steady "we suck" streak

2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[02:44:17] technically they started as vaginas, so what's in the water is having a reverse effect

2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[15:12:12] what? you didn't like pokemon on the apple watch?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[15:12:35] or the fact that they actually spent time describing how you would play the mario game?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[15:15:11] lol

2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[18:10:12] the other 2 are way too expensive
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[18:53:25] Create 2 is cool but I prefer tinkering with building the base cause that's where half the fun / learning is 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[20:04:35] Need a 3d printer
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[20:19:42]  There's a few shops where you can send design and get print 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[20:19:52] No need to buy device 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[21:10:34] elventails: in mtl?

2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:19:02] I think one can safely say it's the most boring product unveiling in a long time! Getting excited over bloody headphones! Geez
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:20:59] Also most annoying voice ever Johnny Ive who gets exited at the slightest curve in anything he touches. I think he gets wet dreams involving bezels ceramic and aluminum! 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:21:35] Fucking hate it when a designer mouths off like its the best thing to happen since sliced bread
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:22:50] Such egomaniacal tendencies when wallowing in the same product loop cannot be forgiven 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:30:34] https://www.fastcodesign.com/3063532/has-jonathan-ive-designed-himself-out-of-existence
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:32:00] And that was my impression before reading the article above. I guess a lot of people seem to share that opinion
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:37:56] samuraii: total ijree fiyon
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:38:02] samuraii: I mean totally agree
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:41:46] No they deserve it for iterating all these years rather than leading innovation
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:42:39] Steve Jobs was not only into design he was into customer experience which directly influenced design. This guy is into design shoved down the user's throat
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:43:23] I totally think there's a problem of innovation at Apple partly out of fear and partly out of design "masturbation". Apt enough description
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:46:19] samuraii: man - they don't need to design - they're not being challenged
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:46:28] samuraii: they can shelve any innovation and leave it for later..
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:46:38] samuraii: competition phones are blowing up by themselves
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:46:44] samuraii: they're cruising
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:46:56] True with the latest note 7 fiasco
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:47:20] But still they were considered market innovators not because they were challenged from outside 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:47:45] Because they were challenged from within by a charismatic CEO 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:47:50] samuraii: do you ever use market research reports?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:48:04] Tom Cook is good and all but hardly inspiring
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:48:11] Sometimes yes
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:48:18] any specific source?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:49:22] No usually it depends on the market segment I'm looking into
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:49:50] I would find which consulting group is the most influential and use their market research as a cornerstone
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:50:21] Sometimes I find the reference in a related article or press releases where they mention the study they get their numbers from
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:50:35] Anything I particular you need?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:50:39] nah just wondering
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:50:43] (thanks good ideas)
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:50:47] Tom Cook is Tim Cook's macho twin brother?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:50:56] maybe curious about gartner reports - but clearly they cost a bazillion
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:51:05] Tom before he turned gay
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:51:09] its his male name
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:51:10] lol

2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:51:35] Gartner is good but high level not worth the money
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:52:02] The lat at one I'm looking into is from mandiant consulting m-trends 2016
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:52:37] Leviathan: using your advice! Bloody autocorrect ☠
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:53:08] samuraii: security specific?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:53:31] Yes state of breaches across the industry
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:53:33] ☠
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:53:35] cool
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:54:29] I usually find that going through McKenzie reports often lands me on some good sources they base their analysis on 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:55:17] eh 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:55:20] Often times they do an excellent job summarizing the market reports themselves 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:55:30] I see what you mean
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:55:38] I'd love to access gartner to see what its like
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:55:47] but iirc - it costs an arm and a leg
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:56:04] If it's industry specific it should cost less 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:56:18] If you want broad access then perhaps it will be steep
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:56:37] cool thanks - will check / been wondering about this for some time but not getting the chance to check
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:57:51] I usually get their summaries 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[08:58:32] Also check out "the information" good insight and costs less
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:58:52] hadn't heard of it - thanks will check
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:00:36] Ur welcome!

2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:09:35] what do you guys use that for again?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:09:48] Problem is finding a good omnichannel provider so as not to have mayhem and confusion!
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:10:11] Not using it yet! Tease arching use cases to propose to upper management 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:10:23] Looking into

2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:13:50] One
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:14:08] Swiftkey ain't so hot on iOS 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:14:23] I used extensively on my old android
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:14:57] Somehow I feel the iPhone keyboard is made for small hands
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:16:09] Ps4 pro is out
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:16:30] Can't play 4K blue ray discs wtf!!
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:17:16] Yes we have a new console 4K everything except you can't play 4K blu Ray discs. We thought it would be cool
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:17:19] Geez 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:18:09] They should call it ps4 pro 2illa
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:24:21] samuraii: did they price their VR headset?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:24:48] Lemme check
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:26:06] 349£
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:26:21] October 13
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:26:31] U.K. Release 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:27:14] that's the ps4 pro
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:27:16] or the vr headset?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:27:20] VR 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:27:27] salbeh
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:27:31] Strangely close dates though
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:27:33] so vr alone is 349?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:27:40] Ps4 pro is in November 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:27:53] they didn't bundle it /etc..
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:27:58] 3 weeks after 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:28:04] Doesn't seem so
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:28:42] But they just might however pricing of the bundle puts it at a disadvantage to the new xbox 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:28:58] I think they won't sell them together for marketing reasons
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:29:03] Drives down sales
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:29:27] so around $600 CAD for the headset
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:29:36] and another $600-$700 CAD or the machine
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:29:47] They've already confused people with a ps4 slim and this
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:29:54] they should release the headset 3a xmas...
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:29:54] Pretty much
2016-09-09 09:48:10	samuraii	[09:30:21] It would have made more sense since the hardware to drive it proper will be out almost a month after
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:58:36] samuraii: got a desktop nearby?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:58:50] samuraii: with a camera + earphones

2016-09-09 09:48:10	Kod	[23:04:34] :P
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[01:58:28] they revealed Joanna's ass
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:31:06] so I hit the Swift literal parsing bug
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:31:30] building the project took 20 minutes
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:31:39] after investigation, learned about this bug
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:32:09] type inference starts to take exponential time when you have literals in big arrays or dictionaries 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:32:27] I have an array that has 240 dictionary literals that each have 2 key/value literals
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:32:32] took 20 minutes to compile that :P
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:44:47] leviathan: so you need to explicitly indicate the type?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:44:52] leviathan: khawet
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[08:44:57] php mish hek lol

2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:56:28] it's fixed in Swift 3
2016-09-09 09:48:10	leviathan	[08:59:14] nice.. reminds me a bit of Bioshock for some reason
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:03:46] yes it does have that feel
2016-09-09 09:48:10	elventails	[09:03:49] made in Montreal btw

2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[04:18:43] Bye duke nukem is due for re-release
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:50:40] *woman

2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:52:46] Mascons one is correct for an old shoot'm up its still quite entertaining
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:53:24] Message was garbled first time and sent by mistake a second time
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:53:45] blame autocorrect 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:53:53] Always 😂
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:55:05] and to make it absolutely clear, cause "gun = fun" can still be thought to mean something else, samuraii meant to type "it's still a fun game"
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:55:35] probably too early for elventails, didn't get his coffee yet :P

2016-09-09 16:47:11	Kod	[15:16:06] but if the rumours are true, I am not happy with the removal of the headphones jack
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-09 16:47:11	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.

2016-09-09 16:47:11	Kod	[15:18:01] I am guessing that's why bose released their newest wireless headphones/earphones

2016-09-09 16:47:11	Kod	[18:10:12] the other 2 are way too expensive
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[18:53:25] Create 2 is cool but I prefer tinkering with building the base cause that's where half the fun / learning is

2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[20:19:42]  There's a few shops where you can send design and get print

2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:19:02] I think one can safely say it's the most boring product unveiling in a long time! Getting excited over bloody headphones! Geez
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:20:59] Also most annoying voice ever Johnny Ive who gets exited at the slightest curve in anything he touches. I think he gets wet dreams involving bezels ceramic and aluminum! 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:21:35] Fucking hate it when a designer mouths off like its the best thing to happen since sliced bread
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:22:50] Such egomaniacal tendencies when wallowing in the same product loop cannot be forgiven 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:30:34] https://www.fastcodesign.com/3063532/has-jonathan-ive-designed-himself-out-of-existence
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:32:00] And that was my impression before reading the article above. I guess a lot of people seem to share that opinion
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:37:56] samuraii: total ijree fiyon
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:38:02] samuraii: I mean totally agree
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:41:46] No they deserve it for iterating all these years rather than leading innovation
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:42:39] Steve Jobs was not only into design he was into customer experience which directly influenced design. This guy is into design shoved down the user's throat
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:43:23] I totally think there's a problem of innovation at Apple partly out of fear and partly out of design "masturbation". Apt enough description
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:46:19] samuraii: man - they don't need to design - they're not being challenged
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:46:28] samuraii: they can shelve any innovation and leave it for later..
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:46:38] samuraii: competition phones are blowing up by themselves
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:46:44] samuraii: they're cruising
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:46:56] True with the latest note 7 fiasco
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:47:20] But still they were considered market innovators not because they were challenged from outside 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:47:45] Because they were challenged from within by a charismatic CEO 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:47:50] samuraii: do you ever use market research reports?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:48:04] Tom Cook is good and all but hardly inspiring
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:48:11] Sometimes yes
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:48:18] any specific source?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:49:22] No usually it depends on the market segment I'm looking into
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:49:50] I would find which consulting group is the most influential and use their market research as a cornerstone
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:50:21] Sometimes I find the reference in a related article or press releases where they mention the study they get their numbers from
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:50:35] Anything I particular you need?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:50:39] nah just wondering
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:50:43] (thanks good ideas)
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:50:47] Tom Cook is Tim Cook's macho twin brother?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:50:56] maybe curious about gartner reports - but clearly they cost a bazillion
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:51:05] Tom before he turned gay
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:51:09] its his male name
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:51:10] lol

2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:51:35] Gartner is good but high level not worth the money

2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:52:37] Leviathan: using your advice! Bloody autocorrect ☠
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:53:08] samuraii: security specific?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:53:31] Yes state of breaches across the industry
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:53:33] ☠
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:53:35] cool
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:54:29] I usually find that going through McKenzie reports often lands me on some good sources they base their analysis on 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:55:17] eh 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:55:20] Often times they do an excellent job summarizing the market reports themselves 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:55:30] I see what you mean
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:55:38] I'd love to access gartner to see what its like
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:55:47] but iirc - it costs an arm and a leg
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:56:04] If it's industry specific it should cost less 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:56:18] If you want broad access then perhaps it will be steep
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:56:37] cool thanks - will check / been wondering about this for some time but not getting the chance to check
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:57:51] I usually get their summaries 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[08:58:32] Also check out "the information" good insight and costs less
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:58:52] hadn't heard of it - thanks will check
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:00:36] Ur welcome!

2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:04:39] so yeah - because of the UI I bucket "the information" in "ayre fiyon" lol
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:04:47] Yep! Well it's pretty standard across these types

2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:09:35] what do you guys use that for again?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:09:48] Problem is finding a good omnichannel provider so as not to have mayhem and confusion!
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:10:11] Not using it yet! Tease arching use cases to propose to upper management 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:10:23] Looking into

2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:13:50] One
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:14:08] Swiftkey ain't so hot on iOS 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:14:23] I used extensively on my old android
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:14:57] Somehow I feel the iPhone keyboard is made for small hands
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:16:09] Ps4 pro is out
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:16:30] Can't play 4K blue ray discs wtf!!
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:17:16] Yes we have a new console 4K everything except you can't play 4K blu Ray discs. We thought it would be cool
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:17:19] Geez 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:18:09] They should call it ps4 pro 2illa
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:24:21] samuraii: did they price their VR headset?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:24:48] Lemme check
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:26:06] 349£
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:26:21] October 13
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:26:31] U.K. Release 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:27:14] that's the ps4 pro
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:27:16] or the vr headset?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:27:20] VR 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:27:27] salbeh
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:27:31] Strangely close dates though
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:27:33] so vr alone is 349?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:27:40] Ps4 pro is in November 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:27:53] they didn't bundle it /etc..
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:27:58] 3 weeks after 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:28:04] Doesn't seem so
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:28:42] But they just might however pricing of the bundle puts it at a disadvantage to the new xbox 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:28:58] I think they won't sell them together for marketing reasons
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:29:03] Drives down sales
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:29:27] so around $600 CAD for the headset
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:29:36] and another $600-$700 CAD or the machine
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:29:47] They've already confused people with a ps4 slim and this
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:29:54] they should release the headset 3a xmas...
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:29:54] Pretty much
2016-09-09 16:47:11	samuraii	[09:30:21] It would have made more sense since the hardware to drive it proper will be out almost a month after
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:58:36] samuraii: got a desktop nearby?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:58:50] samuraii: with a camera + earphones

2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[01:58:28] they revealed Joanna's ass
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:31:06] so I hit the Swift literal parsing bug
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:31:30] building the project took 20 minutes
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:31:39] after investigation, learned about this bug
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:32:09] type inference starts to take exponential time when you have literals in big arrays or dictionaries 
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:32:27] I have an array that has 240 dictionary literals that each have 2 key/value literals
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:32:32] took 20 minutes to compile that :P
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:44:47] leviathan: so you need to explicitly indicate the type?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:44:52] leviathan: khawet
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[08:44:57] php mish hek lol

2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:56:28] it's fixed in Swift 3
2016-09-09 16:47:11	leviathan	[08:59:14] nice.. reminds me a bit of Bioshock for some reason
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:03:46] yes it does have that feel
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:03:49] made in Montreal btw
2016-09-09 16:47:11	elventails	[09:03:53] compulsion games

2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[04:19:03] No BS! Apparently he's also running for president 😂
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[04:19:46] Vaporware you say! It's the very core of it 😂
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[06:35:32] samuraii: that duke nukem has been out for a few years now (6 maybe) - they're just remastering it I believe
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[06:35:37] samuraii: super fun game btw
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[06:38:29] Yeah it is a remastering
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[06:38:59] But I remembered how many times we were promised a new game just for it to turn out vaporware 😄
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[06:39:10] It's still a gun game though true!
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[07:10:51] samuraii: also a fun game, though guns are involved
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[07:11:17] 😁
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:49:35] I don't follow the "it's still a gun game though true"
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:49:48] as well as the "though guns are involved" 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:50:36] duke nukem guys... the game where the women is trapped in a coccoon begging you to "kill me" <-- that game

2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[15:16:14] and this one is probably going to be less exciting that what everyone is looking forward to
2016-09-09 16:48:29	Kod	[15:16:17] I would have some adaptor.

2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[12:53:58] http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[15:04:50] what the fuck is this boring shit from apple?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[15:12:12] what? you didn't like pokemon on the apple watch?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[15:12:35] or the fact that they actually spent time describing how you would play the mario game?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	Kod	[15:15:11] lol

2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[16:36:39] Kod: figured I can develop it on a local machine first then once the concept is proven get the extra hardware

2016-09-09 16:48:29	Kod	[18:10:06] irobot create 2 is really affordable
2016-09-09 16:48:29	Kod	[18:10:12] the other 2 are way too expensive
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[18:53:25] Create 2 is cool but I prefer tinkering with building the base cause that's where half the fun / learning is 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	Kod	[20:04:35] Need a 3d printer
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[20:19:42]  There's a few shops where you can send design and get print 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[20:19:52] No need to buy device 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	Kod	[21:10:34] elventails: in mtl?

2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[23:11:48] :)
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:19:02] I think one can safely say it's the most boring product unveiling in a long time! Getting excited over bloody headphones! Geez
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:20:59] Also most annoying voice ever Johnny Ive who gets exited at the slightest curve in anything he touches. I think he gets wet dreams involving bezels ceramic and aluminum! 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:21:35] Fucking hate it when a designer mouths off like its the best thing to happen since sliced bread
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:22:50] Such egomaniacal tendencies when wallowing in the same product loop cannot be forgiven 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:30:34] https://www.fastcodesign.com/3063532/has-jonathan-ive-designed-himself-out-of-existence
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:32:00] And that was my impression before reading the article above. I guess a lot of people seem to share that opinion
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:37:56] samuraii: total ijree fiyon
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:38:02] samuraii: I mean totally agree
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:41:46] No they deserve it for iterating all these years rather than leading innovation
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:42:39] Steve Jobs was not only into design he was into customer experience which directly influenced design. This guy is into design shoved down the user's throat
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:43:23] I totally think there's a problem of innovation at Apple partly out of fear and partly out of design "masturbation". Apt enough description
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:46:19] samuraii: man - they don't need to design - they're not being challenged
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:46:28] samuraii: they can shelve any innovation and leave it for later..
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:46:38] samuraii: competition phones are blowing up by themselves
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:46:44] samuraii: they're cruising
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:46:56] True with the latest note 7 fiasco
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:47:20] But still they were considered market innovators not because they were challenged from outside 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:47:45] Because they were challenged from within by a charismatic CEO 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:47:50] samuraii: do you ever use market research reports?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:48:04] Tom Cook is good and all but hardly inspiring
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:48:11] Sometimes yes
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:48:18] any specific source?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:49:22] No usually it depends on the market segment I'm looking into
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:49:50] I would find which consulting group is the most influential and use their market research as a cornerstone
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:50:21] Sometimes I find the reference in a related article or press releases where they mention the study they get their numbers from
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:50:35] Anything I particular you need?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:50:39] nah just wondering
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:50:43] (thanks good ideas)
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:50:47] Tom Cook is Tim Cook's macho twin brother?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:50:56] maybe curious about gartner reports - but clearly they cost a bazillion
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:51:05] Tom before he turned gay
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:51:09] its his male name
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:51:10] lol
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:51:13] Loo

2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:51:35] Gartner is good but high level not worth the money
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:52:02] The lat at one I'm looking into is from mandiant consulting m-trends 2016
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:52:37] Leviathan: using your advice! Bloody autocorrect ☠
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:53:08] samuraii: security specific?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:53:31] Yes state of breaches across the industry
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:53:33] ☠
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:53:35] cool
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:54:29] I usually find that going through McKenzie reports often lands me on some good sources they base their analysis on 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:55:17] eh 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:55:20] Often times they do an excellent job summarizing the market reports themselves 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:55:30] I see what you mean
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:55:38] I'd love to access gartner to see what its like
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:55:47] but iirc - it costs an arm and a leg
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:56:04] If it's industry specific it should cost less 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:56:18] If you want broad access then perhaps it will be steep
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:56:37] cool thanks - will check / been wondering about this for some time but not getting the chance to check
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:57:51] I usually get their summaries 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[08:58:32] Also check out "the information" good insight and costs less
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:58:52] hadn't heard of it - thanks will check
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:00:36] Ur welcome!

2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:04:39] so yeah - because of the UI I bucket "the information" in "ayre fiyon" lol
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:04:47] Yep! Well it's pretty standard across these types

2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:12:54] Lol
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:13:16] It starts with sabotaging speech 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:13:21] All hell breaks loose
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:13:29] which app?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:13:43] palaver?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:13:45] Palaver but the keyboard is the standard obe
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:13:50] One
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:14:08] Swiftkey ain't so hot on iOS 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:14:23] I used extensively on my old android
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:14:57] Somehow I feel the iPhone keyboard is made for small hands
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:16:09] Ps4 pro is out
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:16:30] Can't play 4K blue ray discs wtf!!
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:17:16] Yes we have a new console 4K everything except you can't play 4K blu Ray discs. We thought it would be cool
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:17:19] Geez 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:18:09] They should call it ps4 pro 2illa
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:24:21] samuraii: did they price their VR headset?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:24:48] Lemme check
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:26:06] 349£
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:26:21] October 13
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:26:31] U.K. Release 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:27:14] that's the ps4 pro
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:27:16] or the vr headset?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:27:20] VR 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:27:27] salbeh
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:27:31] Strangely close dates though
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:27:33] so vr alone is 349?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:27:40] Ps4 pro is in November 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:27:53] they didn't bundle it /etc..
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:27:58] 3 weeks after 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:28:04] Doesn't seem so
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:28:42] But they just might however pricing of the bundle puts it at a disadvantage to the new xbox 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:28:58] I think they won't sell them together for marketing reasons
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:29:03] Drives down sales
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:29:27] so around $600 CAD for the headset
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:29:36] and another $600-$700 CAD or the machine
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:29:47] They've already confused people with a ps4 slim and this
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:29:54] they should release the headset 3a xmas...
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:29:54] Pretty much
2016-09-09 16:48:29	samuraii	[09:30:21] It would have made more sense since the hardware to drive it proper will be out almost a month after
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:58:36] samuraii: got a desktop nearby?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:58:50] samuraii: with a camera + earphones

2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[01:58:28] they revealed Joanna's ass
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:31:06] so I hit the Swift literal parsing bug
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:31:30] building the project took 20 minutes
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:31:39] after investigation, learned about this bug
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:32:09] type inference starts to take exponential time when you have literals in big arrays or dictionaries 
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:32:27] I have an array that has 240 dictionary literals that each have 2 key/value literals
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:32:32] took 20 minutes to compile that :P
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:44:47] leviathan: so you need to explicitly indicate the type?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:44:52] leviathan: khawet
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[08:44:57] php mish hek lol

2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:56:28] it's fixed in Swift 3
2016-09-09 16:48:29	leviathan	[08:59:14] nice.. reminds me a bit of Bioshock for some reason
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:03:46] yes it does have that feel
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:03:49] made in Montreal btw
2016-09-09 16:48:29	elventails	[09:03:53] compulsion games
