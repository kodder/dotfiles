2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:04:26] hence me trying to roll it back
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:05:46] I am translating a STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guideline) into InSpec tests
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:05:53] ok
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:06:26] but it sounds like you're trying to put these, in a cookbook?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:07:17] Yes, so where I'm working there is a "STIG" cookbook that has recipes for implementing STIG requirements against certain applications
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:08:13] Chef recipes are fundamentally different from Inspec tests
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:08:36] Yes, I know that, so I'm worried we've already diverged again :-/
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:09:00] ok, so that bit of code above
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:09:03] where does that live
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:09:09] like what is it part of?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:09:12] So rather than implementing the stig guidelines in e.g. the apache cookbook itself, they are implemented as application-named recipes in their own "stig" cookbook
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:09:31] because it fits neither the chef DSL or the Inspec DSL
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:10:08] so the cookbook has recipes named after applications. the recipes use Chef resources to apply stig guidelines to the application for which the recipe is named
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:10:17] ok
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:10:51] hmmm as to your above question...it's in a recipe...pretty sure that's normal Chef DSL?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:10:59] file resource
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:11:21] eh, well the file('') bit is odd
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:11:40] yeah I gave it a name, realize now that I don't have to, sorry
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:11:48] and since you were using backticks and then system()
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:11:55] I just wanted to be crystal
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:12:03] ok yeah, that is in a recipe
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:12:21] I just added an example InSpec test to that gist, btw
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:12:39] so you keep saying the recipes implement compliance requirements which is cool but you're translating the requirements into recipes and then you'd be verify them with inspec
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:12:54] so that was the distinction I wanted to make sure was clear
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:12:58] yes exactly
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:13:28] the recipes implement little-c compliance requirements and this cookbook, which has recipes for implementing compliance requirements, also has inspec tests to verify those recipes
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:13:29] in that case, the things I've said still apply
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:13:51] it was just "in my cookbook I am writing InSpec tests for compliance" which I wanted to clear up
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:14:03] if they live in the test dir and are for kitchen etc then all is well
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:14:17] yes so my tests are in test/recipes/apache for the apache recipe
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:14:38] so to me, you'd just write inspec tests - the recipes don't sound like they serve their own purpose
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:15:37] there I think I'm lost again, because I need recipes to enforce the configuration that makes the tests pass
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:15:53] sure but what is the deliverable artifact here?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:16:02] the tests themselves or the recipes?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:16:04] it's really both the recipes and the tests
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:16:32] ok, but why would these recipes be setting permissions - that should be the job of whatever is installing gcc
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:16:39] *there* we go
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:16:54] that gets back to the fundamental place where I think the antipattern may be creeping in from the beginning
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:16:59] like the recipes seem superfluos to the goal
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:17:02] right
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:17:20] i.e. having a cookbook with recipes for implementing compliance for apache rather than just having the apache cookbook implement them
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:17:31] or a cookbook implement them
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:17:34] to me that isn't compliance
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:17:38] that is just requirements
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:17:46] compliance is about checking things after the fact
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:18:11] for example, if you wanted you'd write your own CORP apache cookbook
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:18:16] or wrap the apache cookbook
2016-09-01 14:20:32	@cheeseplus	[14:18:57] (which is to say yes, just have the apache cookbook implement them)
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:19:44] I see that, and how it's probably a best practice. What I'm trying to get across is that it doesn't seem to be the approach in place at the company I'm assisting :-/
2016-09-01 14:20:32	davidcp_	[14:20:08] it seems like they want to have one cookbook install apache and another implement the stig configuration for apache

2016-09-01 14:45:57	@cheeseplus	I'd write ONE cookbook that does apache and if I want STIG it does that too
2016-09-01 14:46:01	@cheeseplus	in the same place
2016-09-01 14:46:41	@cheeseplus	now if the stig cookbook will always be used with apache, as in it depends on it then you could key off attributes in the apache cookbook to inform the stig cookbook
2016-09-01 14:46:52	@cheeseplus	stig-apache if you will
2016-09-01 14:48:11	davidcp_	yeah that makes total sense
2016-09-01 14:48:25	@cheeseplus	to your point - I don't think the distinct cookbook approach is meaningful because the end test is going to test the conjunction of the two anyway
2016-09-01 14:48:51	davidcp_	yes, hence I've had to make the stig cookbook depend on the application cookbook anyway
2016-09-01 14:48:53	@cheeseplus	like the last thing I need or want is two different cookbooks or even recipes in the same cookbook touching the same shit

2016-09-01 14:52:23	davidcp_	ok last question about Compliance (big C this time): how are profiles stored on the Compliance Server as profiles? are they just uploaded as test files or something? and when would I want to "scan" with Chef Compliance vs hooking compliance tests into a node's runlist (if I understand these two alternatives correctly from the docs)?
2016-09-01 14:53:47	@cheeseplus	how are the profiles stored? -> what does that mean?
2016-09-01 14:54:06	@cheeseplus	like you upload them via the UI and they live alongside built-in rules
2016-09-01 14:54:12	davidcp_	so I understand from the docs that Chef Compliance server has "profiles"
2016-09-01 14:54:17	@cheeseplus	right
2016-09-01 14:54:23	davidcp_	right, some are built-in

2016-09-01 14:56:25	@cheeseplus	how you want to scan is up to you
2016-09-01 14:56:34	@cheeseplus	Compliance lets you do adhoc or scheduled scans
2016-09-01 14:56:40	@cheeseplus	against a node, nodes, or groups of nodes
2016-09-01 14:56:51	davidcp_	ok cool, so it is actually a directory structure
2016-09-01 14:56:53	@cheeseplus	the machines don't necessarily have to have chef
2016-09-01 14:57:16	@cheeseplus	yea
2016-09-01 14:57:24	@cheeseplus	we have a few on the supermarket as well
2016-09-01 14:57:29	@cheeseplus	as examples
2016-09-01 14:57:36	davidcp_	ok I'll look those up
2016-09-01 14:57:37	@cheeseplus	you can run inspec directly against a profile
2016-09-01 14:57:48	@cheeseplus	or have it run from compliance

2016-09-01 14:58:33	@cheeseplus	there is a feature in chef-client called audit-node, which would run a post converge compliance test, however it was written with serverspec and Chef Analytics in mind
2016-09-01 14:59:19	davidcp_	ah ok. so is scanning from Compliance considered the normal/best approach?
2016-09-01 14:59:23	@cheeseplus	compliance/inspec came along later and so there is an `audit cookbook` for running compliance scans at the end of a chef run but eventually it'll probably subsume the existing impl
2016-09-01 14:59:34	@cheeseplus	davidcp_: that is again up to you
2016-09-01 14:59:49	@cheeseplus	there really isn't a best practice as everyone uses it differently
2016-09-01 14:59:54	davidcp_	ok
2016-09-01 14:59:58	@cheeseplus	some people use it strictly for compliance
2016-09-01 15:00:04	@cheeseplus	and don't care about the integration

2016-09-01 16:48:17	stephenh	soo.. any takers for http://hastebin.com/sozufiniye.tex and why I get undefined method?
2016-09-01 16:48:48	@coderanger	stephenh: Because you are defining the method in the resource context, not the provider context
2016-09-01 16:48:49	stephenh	this is something I used to do, so wondering it's a chef 12.9.18 thing
2016-09-01 16:49:18	@coderanger	You can use the action_class helper to define things on the provider
2016-09-01 16:49:22	stephenh	ah, I was wondering about that because now provider and resource content live in the same file  (this seems to be the new thing?)
2016-09-01 16:49:35	@coderanger	Kind of, they are in one file but there are still two classes
2016-09-01 16:50:00	@coderanger	Resource#action is creating an "action class" for you under the hood which is a sub of Chef::Provider
2016-09-01 16:50:13	@coderanger	Anything complex enough to need helpers, you should probably not use the fused syntax anymore
2016-09-01 16:50:14	stephenh	interesting, so can I assume that stuff inside the action :create block is provider and the rest outside is resource?
2016-09-01 16:50:24	@coderanger	It's best for things that are basically macros
2016-09-01 16:50:30	@coderanger	Yes
2016-09-01 16:50:39	stephenh	got you...

2016-09-01 16:51:43	stephenh	so normally I would stick that sort of thing into a library but feel libraries should be 'pure ruby' and not chef DSL.. unless perhaps it needed to be accessed by different resources?

2016-09-01 16:52:27	stephenh	I'm not sure what is the best/recommended approach here... split into two files or put into my helper module
2016-09-01 16:52:30	@coderanger	That feeling is incorrect
2016-09-01 16:52:31	@coderanger	:)
2016-09-01 16:52:51	stephenh	well I sounds like I'm putting this method into the library then? :)

2016-09-01 16:53:06	@coderanger	I mean there is a distinction between "plain Ruby code" and "DSL extensions" (of which custom resources and providers are specific types)
2016-09-01 16:53:28	@coderanger	But both live under libraries/ so you can't use that as the classifier
2016-09-01 16:53:59	@coderanger	That method needs DSL access so it has to be a DSL extension of some kind, more likely it will just be clearer to define a separate provider class
2016-09-01 16:54:08	@coderanger	But it's up to you, action_class do ... end exists too
2016-09-01 16:54:15	@coderanger	if you put the def inside that block, it would work
2016-09-01 16:54:35	@coderanger	Or un-refactor to not use a helper method

2016-09-01 17:56:08	stephenh	I wonder if something has changed with chefspec because it's like I don't need to mock anything since upgrading chefdk.  e.g. I have a resource with an only_if block that has ::File.exists? but apparently don't need to mock that (tests that expect file to exist pass, tests that expect it not to fail)
2016-09-01 17:56:36	stephenh	sounds weird but that's what I'm seeing
2016-09-01 17:56:57	@coderanger	Are you sure the resource is evaluating at all?

2016-09-01 18:01:10	stephenh	how do you mean?  that is it actually being actioned or evaluating if the file exists?

2016-09-01 18:02:35	@coderanger	Basically make sure you can make your tests red before you can make them green
2016-09-01 18:02:42	@coderanger	Otherwise you don't know what you are testing
2016-09-01 18:03:02	stephenh	indeed....
2016-09-01 18:03:59	stephenh	so I didn't have a test, coverage report told me I had an untouched resource, I wrote test (without stubbing ::File.exist?), it passed, I wrote another test stubbing ::File.exist? returns false, it fails
2016-09-01 18:04:14	stephenh	http://michaellihs.github.io/devops/2015/07/28/chefspec.html copied this method of stubbing ::File
2016-09-01 18:04:45	@coderanger	Do you mean ChefSpec's coverage system or SimpleCov?
2016-09-01 18:05:08	stephenh	chefspec's
2016-09-01 18:05:09	@coderanger	Because ChefSpec's is a lot more rudimentary, I've never seen much point to it in the first place
2016-09-01 18:05:31	@coderanger	It only groks resource action execution
2016-09-01 18:05:38	@coderanger	Not actual line's being run.
2016-09-01 18:05:38	stephenh	it just checks if all resources have a test basically
2016-09-01 18:05:43	@coderanger	No, it doesn't
2016-09-01 18:05:55	@coderanger	It checks that all resources _have been executed_
2016-09-01 18:06:16	stephenh	that's true I guess

2016-09-01 18:07:35	@coderanger	Coverage reporting is a fickle beast to start with (Ruby has C0 at best)
2016-09-01 18:07:49	@coderanger	red-green testing/refactoring is a better judge :)
2016-09-01 18:09:08	stephenh	I'm still confused why I can't stub ::File.exists? returns false, or why I don't need to stub it at all for my execute resource
2016-09-01 18:09:15	stephenh	I would've thought chefspec would've borked at that
2016-09-01 18:09:22	@coderanger	You can stub it, its just ruby code at that point
2016-09-01 18:09:35	@coderanger	Most likely you aren't testing what you think you are testing
2016-09-01 18:09:52	@coderanger	But remember that is you don't stub exist? or any other methods, they just run as normal
2016-09-01 18:09:59	@coderanger	Meaning you get the results you would from your local FS
2016-09-01 18:10:07	stephenh	indeed
2016-09-01 18:10:14	stephenh	so would've expected it to say can't open file
2016-09-01 18:10:23	@coderanger	exists? doesn't try opening the file
2016-09-01 18:10:27	@coderanger	It's a stat
2016-09-01 18:10:30	stephenh	well file exists
2016-09-01 18:11:03	stephenh	either way, no error :P
2016-09-01 18:11:04	@coderanger	It either returns true or false, the only thing that would make it error is stat itself returning an unusual error
2016-09-01 18:11:25	stephenh	the same when I use a helper library that does a shell_out, previously I had to stub it, not any more ...
2016-09-01 18:11:36	stephenh	helper method I mean
2016-09-01 18:12:18	@coderanger	It was probably just actually running
2016-09-01 18:12:35	@coderanger	Which probably means you don't have adequate error checking in your code :)
2016-09-01 18:13:25	stephenh	the .exe is not going to run on osx :p
2016-09-01 18:13:38	@coderanger	Indeed, you probably got back an error from shell_out
2016-09-01 18:13:52	@coderanger	if you want it to automatically raise on failure you need to use shell_out!() instead
2016-09-01 18:14:35	@coderanger	shell_out() itself will happily return a cmd object with a non-zero exit status and leave it at that

2016-09-01 19:16:00	fletchowns	for test kitchen can i have a different set of forwarded ports depending on which suite is being run? db suite would have 5432, app suite would have 443, etc

2016-09-01 19:16:18	fletchowns	or do i just forward both ports at the driver level and not worry about it?
2016-09-01 19:16:35	@coderanger	fletchowns: TK doesn't know anything about port forwards, but you can customize the driver config for each suite

2016-09-01 19:18:35	@coderanger	That's up to the driver
2016-09-01 19:18:40	@coderanger	Probably?
2016-09-01 19:18:49	@coderanger	Why are you forwarding ports to the test VM at all
2016-09-01 19:18:55	@coderanger	That's a weird thing to do
2016-09-01 19:19:22	fletchowns	that's another thing i was wondering :)

2016-09-01 19:21:22	fletchowns	we currently use a Vagrantfile to spin up a dev machine, recipes to install gnome, intellij, etc
2016-09-01 19:21:33	fletchowns	so we forward ports for tomcat, postgres, etc
2016-09-01 19:21:53	@coderanger	Okay, so using TK for dev provisioning, not testing?
2016-09-01 19:22:03	fletchowns	yea
2016-09-01 19:22:22	@coderanger	Then yeah, put a bit of driver config in each suite to do what you want
2016-09-01 19:22:25	@coderanger	Weird, but fine :)
2016-09-01 19:22:56	@coderanger	Add a `driver:` section to the suite
2016-09-01 19:23:03	@coderanger	anything in there is merged
2016-09-01 19:23:10	@coderanger	you can do the same for platforms
2016-09-01 19:23:31	fletchowns	ok sweet, that sounds like what i'm looking for
2016-09-01 19:23:47	@coderanger	Use `kitchen diagnose` to check the final merged data for each suite
2016-09-01 19:24:13	fletchowns	awesome
2016-09-01 19:24:27	fletchowns	is there an alternative way to go about this that's not considered weird? am i misusing TK?

2016-09-01 19:32:12	@coderanger	docker-compose seems to get a lot of airtime, but that means building your whole pipeline around docker images
2016-09-01 19:32:41	@coderanger	Personally I've given up on all hopes of "dev is like prod" for most setups

2016-09-01 19:33:30	@coderanger	But I grok why others want prod-like at the edge too

2016-09-01 19:34:18	pauzed	we've been letting our $devs connect to the actual dev environment we manage so they can use some back end services that they may not wish to run locally
2016-09-01 19:35:01	pauzed	for us, its really become unfeasible to expect a developer to run every single service in our stack
2016-09-01 19:38:14	@coderanger	Yeah, that doesn't work well for stateful stuff though.
2016-09-01 19:39:16	pauzed	agreed, our apps are all stateless, connecting to databases and such, which makes it a fair bit less painful

2016-09-01 19:46:49	fletchowns	our stack isn't terribly complicated, the Vagrantfile has been working really well for us to get prod like dev environment. i could see how that breaks down with more complicated setups though

2016-09-01 19:49:51	@coderanger	fletchowns: The main benefit of TK+Vagrant over pure Vagrant is just the cookbook download and transfer is a little more reliable. vagrant-berkshelf is famously wonky

2016-09-02 14:13:21	segv	[20:08:02] you are the bane of my existance
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fletchowns	[20:31:38] how much do i need to copy over to my .kitchen.local.yml to be able to override something?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fletchowns	[20:32:07] i just wanted to override something for one suite, but now TK thinks i only have the 1 suite
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fletchowns	[20:32:14] do i have to copy over all the stuff i don't want to change as well?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@coderanger	[22:28:01] No, it gets merged
2016-09-02 14:13:21	westerbot	[06:20:47] Hi chefs, anybody interested in a bug report for chef-client 12.14.40? It’s not yet released, I stummbled across an issue with the users resource
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Philipp_	[06:58:00] Guys I have a machine where I can run chef-client fine but if I start /etc/init.d/chef-client is does not work
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@cheeseplus	[08:03:34] Philipp_: ok, any logs or errors?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	trilitheus	[08:45:58] Hi wonder if anyone got any pointers on how to stub this guard?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	trilitheus	[08:46:11] not_if { ::File.stat('/path/to/file').uid == 6001 }
2016-09-02 14:13:21	trilitheus	[08:46:18] in chefspec
2016-09-02 14:13:21	trilitheus	[08:50:16] I'm executing a bash resource to recursively change ownership on a (largish) directory so want this to only do if a file contained in the directory isn;t correctly owned
2016-09-02 14:13:21	izghitu	[09:47:34] Hi, can I use <%= @config['someattribute'] %> inside directory '/path/to/<%= @config['someattribute'] %>" do ?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	izghitu	[09:48:18] or what would be the best way to use a variable inside a directory '' resource?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fryguy	[10:09:52] izghitu: string interpolation in ruby is #{}
2016-09-02 14:13:21	izghitu	[10:10:11] thanks
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fryguy	[10:10:12] izghitu: "/path/to/#{@config['someattribute']}"
2016-09-02 14:13:21	drywheat	[10:24:43] i'm having a hard time getting `chef generate cookbook' to read my knife.rb config. the email/license/author values do not use my defined value. has anyone encountered this?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fryguy	[10:28:31] drywheat: where is your knife.rb located
2016-09-02 14:13:21	fryguy	[10:28:50] and do non-knife commands even use knife.rb anymore? (I'm not sure)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	drywheat	[10:30:04] ~/.chef/knife.rb
2016-09-02 14:13:21	drywheat	[10:30:08] fryguy: ^^^
2016-09-02 14:13:21	drywheat	[10:30:36] are you suggesting that perhaps it's using client.rb, or something else?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	drywheat	[10:34:03] the docs indicate that knife.rb is being used. inserting a "raise 'blah'" into the file causes `chef generate' to bomb out as well
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@cheeseplus	[10:51:57] chef generate may use config.rb (which is where things have slowly been moving)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@cheeseplus	[10:52:00] will check
2016-09-02 14:13:21	techminer	[10:57:16] does anyone use guard-kitchen anymore?  it seems that plugin hasn't been touched in a while.  I tried to enable it but get an error when I run guard init.  Not a big deal, just curious.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@cheeseplus	[10:58:30] it shoudn't need much
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@cheeseplus	[10:58:52] I mean it's just a set of fsync triggers effectively, not really a deep integration
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@cheeseplus	[10:59:10] been a bit since I've used it but not sure it really needs updating
2016-09-02 14:13:21	techminer	[11:13:57] Ah…doesn't support Guard 2 yet so I needed this fork…. https://github.com/test-kitchen/guard-kitchen/pull/6
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jwr	[11:42:43] when installing chef-compliance, the docs say to do `chef-compliance-ctl reconfigure`. what's a good idempotence check for that?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	JediNut	[12:01:57] Hi everyone… I have a quick question.  Is it possible to use the node's environment in an attribute?  For example, I want the path to a directory to change depending on what environment the node is in:  "target_dir": "/var/target/#{node[chef_environment]}"  (This didn't work, nor did a whole bunch of other stuff I tried)
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jwr	[12:05:07] JediNut: grepping through some of my cookbooks I see that we have some "somestring-#{node.chef_environment}" attributes.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	JediNut	[12:05:32] I thought I tried that…but let me give it a go again.  Thanks.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	JediNut	[12:08:15] Nope…didn't get replaced with the environment.  Does it matter if it is set as a default or override attribute?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jwr	[12:09:22] the ones we're using are default attributes. i can't imagine there would be a difference, though.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	JediNut	[12:12:25] Yea…I just tried it both ways and it didn't make a difference.  I am setting mine in a "role" which I am applying to the nodes…do you think that'd make a difference?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	JediNut	[12:38:24] I guess I could do it with some logic in the recipe, but it seems like overkill. :-(
2016-09-02 14:13:21	ryanneufeld	[12:43:49] is it possible to include a databag from an included recipe?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jwr	[12:44:33] databags are independent of recipes.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	ryanneufeld	[12:46:08] okay, so rspec is failing because it can't find the data bag of an included recipe
2016-09-02 14:13:21	ryanneufeld	[12:51:33] jwr: so that doesn't really help me
2016-09-02 14:13:21	mr_chris	[12:53:44] I'm working with chef-solo in Packer. What is the best way to view attributes during a chef-solo run?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	dhoer	[13:03:50] where do I find an example using mount on windows?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jwr	[13:15:02] i set up a brand new chef-compliance, and upon trying to view the dashboard i'm getting a blank screen in my browser. logs show 401 http responses. anybody know how to troubleshoot that?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@cheeseplus	[13:24:45] jwr: support is best for that, you can't really get your hands on it otherwise
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jwr	[13:28:52] cheeseplus: thanks. i can get chef standard support even without a license or anything? this is for self-hosted chef-compliance.
2016-09-02 14:13:21	@cheeseplus	[13:33:18] I mean there is a 30 day support 8x5
2016-09-02 14:13:21	jwr	[13:34:25] cool, thanks. i'll try the install again, just for fun, and if i get blocked at the same spot i'll open a ticket. thanks.

2016-09-02 19:14:30	shortdudey123	i am going through cookbooks that i use for chef 13 deprecation warnings... but i am confused on one

2016-09-02 19:14:46	shortdudey123	that line is being marked "method access to node attributes (node.foo.bar) is deprecated and will be removed in Chef 13"
2016-09-02 19:14:53	@coderanger	shortdudey123: Yeah, it should be node['platform']
2016-09-02 19:15:03	shortdudey123	ah
2016-09-02 19:15:05	@coderanger	remember attr files happen in the context of the node object
2016-09-02 19:15:13	shortdudey123	gotcha, thanks!!
2016-09-02 19:15:14	@coderanger	so default == node.default
2016-09-02 19:15:19	@coderanger	and platform == node.platform
2016-09-02 19:15:30	shortdudey123	gotcha
2016-09-02 19:15:33	@coderanger	you could also do self['node']
2016-09-02 19:15:48	@coderanger	but node has `def node self end` on it to keep consistent syntax

2016-09-02 19:56:15	fletchowns	ah yea i saw that one, i was wondering about the knife node edit command to set policy group & file on an existing node that hasn't used policies before
2016-09-02 19:56:47	fletchowns	or does that just return json that has policy_name & policy_group for me to set?
2016-09-02 19:56:55	fletchowns	i haven't used knife node edit yet =)
2016-09-02 19:56:58	@coderanger	Oh, just add "policy_group": "whatever", to the JSON

2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:15:49] :)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	shortdudey123	[19:16:05] ah lol
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:16:06] Also <3 for actually fixing deprecation warnings
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:16:15] er, I meant self['platform']
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:16:18] but you get the idea
2016-09-03 12:26:25	shortdudey123	[19:16:25] yup, i know what you meant :p
2016-09-03 12:26:25	troyready	[19:29:30] coderanger: thanks!
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:34:19] ok so for the "hoisting" part of https://yolover.poise.io/ the default["SN1"]["app"]["dbhost"] = "..." part would go in my _base.rb policy?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:34:54] It goes whereever you want
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:35:06] That is orthogonal to policy inheritance
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:40:11] would something like this be weird? https://gist.github.com/fletchowns/06946ec50e419c43b1494bdd0fb7a605
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:40:28] i don't think i get it yet...
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:41:17] That seems normal
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:41:26] It's just a way to set what used to be environment-level attributes
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:42:30] How you use them is up to you
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:50:47] how do you associate existing nodes with a policy group?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:51:27] knife node edit
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:51:28] or similar
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:53:48] is there an example usage? i can't seem to find one in the docs
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:55:31] https://github.com/poise/poise-hoist#quick-start
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:55:42] Hoist is my thing, it's not a Chef feature
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:56:15] ah yea i saw that one, i was wondering about the knife node edit command to set policy group & file on an existing node that hasn't used policies before
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:56:47] or does that just return json that has policy_name & policy_group for me to set?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:56:55] i haven't used knife node edit yet =)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[19:56:58] Oh, just add "policy_group": "whatever", to the JSON
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[19:57:07] ahh ok, now it makes sense
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[20:04:20] how does poise-hoist know which attributes need to be moved up a level in the nesting?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[20:04:50] It merges everything under node[node.policy_group]
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[20:10:07] right on =)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fletchowns	[20:10:09] thanks as always!
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:14:20] hey folks, anyone around familiar with installing chef-backend (for HA deployments)?
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[22:15:47] funjon: Probably not a ton of people, but you can always ack
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[22:15:49] er, ask
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[22:16:12] Also remember that support is included with your Premium subscription, you can always reach them at support@chef.io
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:16:42] yeah, but we're trying to stand up things that are time-sensitive :(
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:16:52] i'm trying to avoid firing a P1 ticket if i can
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:16:59] but we are sufficiently time-squeezed that I might have to
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[22:17:18] I mean that's literally the point of paying for commercial support :)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:17:26] anyway, I'm trying to stand up the backends, and after creating a cluster on the first node, I get "Unable to authenticate to postgresql from this node" when I try to join the rest of the nodes
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:17:47] yeah i know but it's a holiday weekend and i know some of the cats there so i'm trying to be moderately self-sufficient
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[22:17:55] Yeah, that's sufficiently specific that I would invoke a support ticket.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:18:14] yeah
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:18:20] sadly i suspect that will be the answer
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[22:18:52] That's totally what they are there for.
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:18:59] yeah i know
2016-09-03 12:26:25	@coderanger	[22:19:19] I know ssd was on Slack earlier, but probably asleep by now (3AM in the UK)
2016-09-03 12:26:25	funjon	[22:22:32] thanks sir
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fryguy	[00:06:25] i'm trying to bootstrap a node and I'm getting this message when running it from some code, but only on a single server (so it seems).  any idea what can cause this:
2016-09-03 12:26:25	fryguy	[00:06:28] https://gist.github.com/bryanalves/f98b5505c4c8449cc448e5bc5f4af4fe

2016-09-03 12:31:44	b1n4ry	Hello, I've been trying to include a recipe from the same cookbook inside a ruby block using run_context. But the recipe is never included. I made sure that the recipe is not included in any other phase. Is there an alternative to include recipe inside a ruby block? or why the inclusion might be failing?

2016-09-04 12:32:21	troyready	[19:29:30] coderanger: thanks!
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:34:19] ok so for the "hoisting" part of https://yolover.poise.io/ the default["SN1"]["app"]["dbhost"] = "..." part would go in my _base.rb policy?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:34:54] It goes whereever you want
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:35:06] That is orthogonal to policy inheritance
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:40:11] would something like this be weird? https://gist.github.com/fletchowns/06946ec50e419c43b1494bdd0fb7a605
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:40:28] i don't think i get it yet...
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:41:17] That seems normal
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:41:26] It's just a way to set what used to be environment-level attributes
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:42:30] How you use them is up to you
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:50:47] how do you associate existing nodes with a policy group?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:51:27] knife node edit
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:51:28] or similar
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:53:48] is there an example usage? i can't seem to find one in the docs
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:55:31] https://github.com/poise/poise-hoist#quick-start
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:55:42] Hoist is my thing, it's not a Chef feature
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:56:15] ah yea i saw that one, i was wondering about the knife node edit command to set policy group & file on an existing node that hasn't used policies before
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:56:47] or does that just return json that has policy_name & policy_group for me to set?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:56:55] i haven't used knife node edit yet =)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[19:56:58] Oh, just add "policy_group": "whatever", to the JSON
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[19:57:07] ahh ok, now it makes sense
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[20:04:20] how does poise-hoist know which attributes need to be moved up a level in the nesting?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[20:04:50] It merges everything under node[node.policy_group]
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[20:10:07] right on =)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fletchowns	[20:10:09] thanks as always!
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:14:20] hey folks, anyone around familiar with installing chef-backend (for HA deployments)?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[22:15:47] funjon: Probably not a ton of people, but you can always ack
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[22:15:49] er, ask
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[22:16:12] Also remember that support is included with your Premium subscription, you can always reach them at support@chef.io
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:16:42] yeah, but we're trying to stand up things that are time-sensitive :(
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:16:52] i'm trying to avoid firing a P1 ticket if i can
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:16:59] but we are sufficiently time-squeezed that I might have to
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[22:17:18] I mean that's literally the point of paying for commercial support :)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:17:26] anyway, I'm trying to stand up the backends, and after creating a cluster on the first node, I get "Unable to authenticate to postgresql from this node" when I try to join the rest of the nodes
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:17:47] yeah i know but it's a holiday weekend and i know some of the cats there so i'm trying to be moderately self-sufficient
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[22:17:55] Yeah, that's sufficiently specific that I would invoke a support ticket.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:18:14] yeah
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:18:20] sadly i suspect that will be the answer
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[22:18:52] That's totally what they are there for.
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:18:59] yeah i know
2016-09-04 12:32:21	@coderanger	[22:19:19] I know ssd was on Slack earlier, but probably asleep by now (3AM in the UK)
2016-09-04 12:32:21	funjon	[22:22:32] thanks sir
2016-09-04 12:32:21	fryguy	[00:06:25] i'm trying to bootstrap a node and I'm getting this message when running it from some code, but only on a single server (so it seems).  any idea what can cause this:

2016-09-04 12:32:21	b1n4ry	[12:31:44] Hello, I've been trying to include a recipe from the same cookbook inside a ruby block using run_context. But the recipe is never included. I made sure that the recipe is not included in any other phase. Is there an alternative to include recipe inside a ruby block? or why the inclusion might be failing?
2016-09-04 12:32:21	izghitu	[04:27:24] Hi
2016-09-04 12:32:21	izghitu	[04:28:22] I have an array %w{something somethingelse somethingelseelse}.each do |var|
2016-09-04 12:32:21	izghitu	[04:29:47] can I use it like this?: if node['qwerty']["#{var}"] == 1
2016-09-04 12:32:21	cochi	[05:14:45] rather   if node['qwerty'].key?(var)     i believe. but i'm out of practice

2016-09-05 21:58:39	brucebag	[21:48:02] is there a way to use knife search to find node names with a missing value?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	brucebag	[21:48:25] the nodename is there, but some nodes are cruft and have no fqdn or ip or role etc
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[21:55:29] brucebag: You can try using a NOT query but in the general case the answer is no
2016-09-05 21:58:39	brucebag	[21:57:38] yeah
2016-09-05 21:58:39	brucebag	[21:58:18] coderanger: yah thought so. guess I can use knife exec and ruby to clean this mess up

2016-09-05 21:58:39	ton31337	[08:31:56] guys, how to upload cookbook to chef-server if I added that recipe inside role
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ton31337	[08:31:57] ?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ton31337	[08:32:04] it's not in wrapper
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ton31337	[08:32:19] just added additional community recipe to my role and uploaded role
2016-09-05 21:58:39	ton31337	[08:32:25] but: The following cookbooks are required by the client but don't exist on the server:
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[13:06:33] So... good place to learn DevOps toolchain?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[14:20:54] getting much more traffic from #jenkins.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[14:20:58] crickets here... ;)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[14:21:14] your question should be more specific :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[14:21:18] hello
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[14:25:16] Where does chef fit into the DevOps toolchain?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[14:25:19] configuration management.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[14:25:21] Right?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	learath	[14:31:04] What are you trying to do?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	learath	[14:31:43] I'd say configuration management is a fair, if somewhat limited, description of chef.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[14:31:45] build my own DevOps toolchain like I've seen demoed...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[14:32:13] I've seen some impressive demos that included chef.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[14:32:21] building the server for the build phase...
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:11:57] Groovin: Chef is a robot sysadmin, things you would otherwise SSH to a server and do by hand, Chef does instead.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[15:13:50] does ruby net http ignores https_proxy setting? I can't run chef-client behind a proxy :(
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:14:52] diegows: All Chef components work 100% behind a proxy
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[15:16:52] using environment variables of some chef-client config
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[15:16:55] ?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[15:17:22] https://gist.github.com/diegows/a1072e6868757813366427a0e7799239
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:18:36] https://docs.chef.io/proxies.html
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:18:39] Theres a whole doc on it :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:19:19] That's an error from the ingredients cookbook, not Chef
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:19:48] You don't need that cookbook to install Chef Server, just download and install the package
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[15:20:42] but I like that quick cuate and paste :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[15:21:21] BTW, I think docs about proxy is not clear, I've set the env vars but doesn't work, it works using client.rb settings
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:22:42] Yeah, the ingredients cookbook is not tested as rigorously as Chef itself.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:23:02] It's maintained by an employee, but definitely a side project comparatively
2016-09-05 21:58:39	diegows	[15:23:26] ok
2016-09-05 21:58:39	xpt	[15:40:58] Hi, I just got couple of machines with VMWare ESXi, I found knife-esx unofficial plugin on github but it's not longer developed. Is there something else I could use to create automatically whole environment or should I look for some other tool and integrate it with chef somehow?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[15:42:57] I think most people use the internal provisioning support within VMWare stuffs, but try knife-vsphere? If you want something actually good for broader usage, maybe try Terraform.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	xpt	[15:48:30] I would like to be as much platform independent as I could so I wanted not to use vmware specific stuff.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	xpt	[15:48:47] I think I'll give Terreform a shot
2016-09-05 21:58:39	xpt	[15:51:54] Can you also suggest a tool that could provide a single 'make whole new live environment' button to pair with Terraform and Chef?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	xpt	[15:52:39] Of course it doesn't need to be literally single button :)
2016-09-05 21:58:39	xpt	[16:11:34] oh, actually terraform does it all for me
2016-09-05 21:58:39	xpt	[16:11:38] coderanger: thank you
2016-09-05 21:58:39	@coderanger	[16:11:56] Yeah, that's what TF does

2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:23:06] you can also run the inspec remotely like kitchen-inspec does  but shell is probably easier
2016-09-06 11:21:04	champagnepopo	[10:28:01] => [["describe", [Processes], #<Proc:0x007fcbaf380c20@(pry):2>]]

2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:33:13] so I'm using my local shell and can get users and states as in the example
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:35:42] champagnepopo: ok, so I see why - those properties are the only ones exposed
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:35:48] in the ruby itself
2016-09-06 11:21:04	champagn1popo	[10:37:57] so it looks like it's getting time from ps aux
2016-09-06 11:21:04	champagn1popo	[10:38:13] which displays like h:mm.ss
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:38:34] sure it may have it internally but it's not exposed at all so you're hosed
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:38:55] easier to just run your own command and grep the stdout
2016-09-06 11:21:04	champagn1popo	[10:40:15] ok thanks cheeseplus
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[10:46:46] i'm installing chef-compliance, and chef-gate has a dependency on chef-server-core. is that really necessary, or can i safely skip that dependency? i want my chef-compliance to be a separate instance from my chef-server.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	buremba	[10:48:29] is it possible to run bash in chef templates? i need to reverse a given ip with (dig +short -x [IP]) and use the output in the template.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[10:49:21] templates can run ruby code, and ruby can run bash
2016-09-06 11:21:04	buremba	[10:54:58] jwr: is this code valid? <% require 'resolv' -%> <%= Resolv.getname("52.44.25.6") -%> ?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:55:19] don't do that in the template though
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:55:23] do it in the recipe
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:55:44] pass it as a variable
2016-09-06 11:21:04	buremba	[10:56:12] cheeseplus: yes i know that this usage is not recommended but i do not have access to the recipe
2016-09-06 11:21:04	buremba	[10:56:38] even though i'm not familiar with ruby
2016-09-06 11:21:04	buremba	[10:56:53] it would be simple for me to include it in the template
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:58:07] I don't understand how you'd have access to the template but not the recipe
2016-09-06 11:21:04	buremba	[10:59:29] cheeplus: i do have access but the template is included dynamically from the recipe and the recipe doesn't actually have any logic for the templates.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[10:59:57] what I'm saying is the logic belongs there, it really shouldn't be in an ERB
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:00:09] it's generally frowned upon to do requires in ERB
2016-09-06 11:21:04	buremba	[11:02:35] you're definitely right. i'm aware that this is a workaround but otherwise the logic in recipe would be hard for me to manage since the templates are rendered dynamically. the recipe doesn't actually know which variables the template need.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:03:14] right, that sounds like a problem waiting to happen and hard to test to boot
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:04:08] I can't even say I've ever tried for that reason
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:05:15] jwr: another one for support
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:05:44] haha, i'm beginning to sense a theme here with chef-compliance.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:05:47] thanks though
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:06:31] well this is volunteer oss support generally speaking so aside from the few crossover customer/community members that will be the case for anything commercial
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:07:15] yeah, understandable.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:07:31] If I knew I'd share but chef-gate is new even for folks that work here/there
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:08:11] only in the past month or so has the auth across multiple products been A Thing (tm)
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:08:48] am i right in thinking that if i didn't ignore this dependency, and i installed chef-server-core, that's basically installing a whole chef-server, right?
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:09:11] that would be my expectation
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:09:31] but I also am like 9000% sure they can run separately cause I know they can
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:09:37] just not sure about that dep
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:09:41] yeah.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:10:12] weirdly, another person on our team did chef-compliance like two months ago and this dependency didn't exist. and it works fine without chef-server-core on that machine.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:10:26] that world is way different
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:10:32] that would have been pre-chefconf
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:10:36] pre-automate
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:10:42] ohhhh
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:10:46] like not even a different world, a different solar system
2016-09-06 11:21:04	@cheeseplus	[11:11:05] compliance was almost entirely standalone then
2016-09-06 11:21:04	 *	cheeseplus [11:11:35] cues Bowie's Changes
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:17:32] i opened a ticket. i'll try to report back here when i get some direction from support, in case it comes up again for somebody else.
2016-09-06 11:21:04	jwr	[11:20:37] i guess i could just install chef-server-core, and just never do chef-server-ctl reconfigure...

2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:34:08] makes sense
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:34:23] looks like the gemfile and berksfile lock files both specify that version in our repo
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:34:34] which does confuse as to why it works on one host
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:34:48] if it had open deps at another point
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:34:52] or if it's using chefdk
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:34:57] there are a few ways
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:35:27] so 4.3.0 is standard stable rn?
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:35:31] for my lockfile
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:35:58] we released 5.0 last week
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:36:20] but it drops ruby 2.1 support so only use if you're setup otherwise
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:36:35] also, if you're running with gemfiles maybe look at using the chefdk
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:36:42] that'll simplify some of this headache
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:38:50] eh, prefer to use gems
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:38:57] more portable
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:39:14] also, updating my berkshelf fixed that. thanks :)
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:39:52] I mean yes but also most people aren't going to be running gems at this stage
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:40:22] if that works for you great but that is kind of why chef-client and chefDK bundle their own ruby and deps
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:40:36] yeah I set our tests up to run mostly on remote docker images
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:40:52] that's where most of the converging happens via CI
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:40:53] gotcha, that makes sense then
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[12:41:17] pretty much the only place I'd suggest to run like that anyway
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:45:10] aw
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:45:16] my comparison didn't work.
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:45:26] it { should < 300 }
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:45:34] ^ ??? how does I less than?
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:45:50] value of 300 coming from awk
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:55:03] you know what, it's occurring to me now that maybe we're approaching this wrong.
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:55:33] our goal is to fail kitchen test if a worker process isn't restarted.  We've been attacking it by uptime, but maybe there's a more inspec friendly way of doing that?
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[12:55:57] what's the best inspec'y way to go 'fail if a service isn't restarted'
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:01:50] so that is the thing, inspec doesn't know anything until it reaches into the system
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:01:58] so you'd need to verify the things restarting
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:02:00] like checking a log
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:02:14] or push it into the recipe logic
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:02:46] this is kinda what I was geting at earlier, it's an odd way to approach something that is a symptom of another problem
2016-09-06 14:03:24	davidcp_	[13:05:36] Hi all, I'm trying to manage the Splunk service with the Chef 'service' resource but keep getting this error:  "The specified service does not exist as an installed service. - OpenService: The specified service does not exist as an installed resource." Any ideas? I can login and use Powershell to list services, and start/stop splunk (known as "SplunkForwarder Service")
2016-09-06 14:03:24	davidcp_	[13:06:36] the Chef error looks like this:  "Error executing action `restart` on resource 'windows_service[SplunkForwarder Service]'"
2016-09-06 14:03:24	davidcp_	[13:10:35] nm, looks like even though I can manage the service from Powershell with "SplunkForwarder Service," I need to use the shorter "Splunkforwarder"
2016-09-06 14:03:24	champagnepopo	[13:21:34] cheeseplus: it is part of the recipe, there's a notifies: restart
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:24:25] sure but I mean the verification that it started seems to me part and parcel if you care about it
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:24:31] either you trust that works or you don't
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:25:09] like you can only check that it is up in a black box scenario like inspec/serverspec try to encourage
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:25:41] so either you have to parse a log of some sort or run a test that hits the service, maybe with a config setting you make that only is enabled after restart
2016-09-06 14:03:24	@cheeseplus	[13:25:53] that way if that option is on, you know it restarted

2016-09-06 14:27:16	jwr	I want to run some commands on one server that will generate some strings, and i want those strings to be used for some other commands on some other servers. Is there a name for that? I imagine somebody already blogged it, but I don't even really know what that's called to google it.

2016-09-06 14:36:50	@coderanger	Setting up those initial security relationships is always hard, it's rarely worth the time to automate unless starting a new Compliance server from scratch is something you do a like (like if you are Chef Software)
2016-09-06 14:37:08	@coderanger	For an individual user, in a DR scenario you would be restoring from backups most likely :)
2016-09-06 14:37:31	@coderanger	So it's just not usually worth the time to dive too deep on the automation if you're going to do it once ever

2016-09-06 15:26:09	@coderanger	While it's from Chef Software, Hab has little to do directly with Chef (they are orthogonal)

2016-09-06 15:35:18	@coderanger	InSpec and Test Kitchen are both related to testing, FoodCritic is a linter which is in a similar orbit to testing but distinct

2016-09-06 15:49:14	iamchrisf	I have cookbooks that load db creds via an encrypted databag.  Setting up test-kitchen so I need to have it load up a test databag.  So I need to create a json file that is already encrypted.
2016-09-06 15:50:30	|rt|	you can use this to create one in place `knife data bag local edit <yourdatabag.json> --secret-file <path to databag secret>`
2016-09-06 15:51:46	|rt|	the existing json file just needs to have the id in place so `echo "{id: 'yourdatabag'}" > yourdatabag.json` then that knife command
2016-09-06 15:52:46	|rt|	you're better off for test kitchen to use a cookbook secret and test data...so you don't have any real secrets in you cookbook's repo
2016-09-06 15:53:30	|rt|	http://atomic-penguin.github.io/blog/2013/06/07/HOWTO-test-kitchen-and-encrypted-data-bags/ has a good write up on this

2016-09-06 15:58:15	iamchrisf	coderanger: I plan on moving to loading db creds via vault into env variables, but that’s a few weeks off.
2016-09-06 15:58:32	@coderanger	Yeah, short term just switch to the `data_bag_item()` API in your code

2016-09-06 15:58:53	emachnic	Does anyone know if there's a way to configure the system type of a node in Chef Compliance? I've got a Windows one that keeps coming up as UNIX
2016-09-06 15:59:04	@coderanger	(or write some similar fallback logic, but don't do that)
2016-09-06 15:59:24	iamchrisf	coderanger: sounds good.  I’ll give that a shot.
2016-09-06 15:59:27	wedgie	how much control do you have over the order in which things that are activated with a 'notifies' are run? I have several resources (more of one of which *may* run on any given chef-client run) which all notify the same resource, but it is important that that last resource executes *after* the others
2016-09-06 15:59:49	@coderanger	emachnic: Asking here is cool but you might not get a ton of people that know Compliance. Support is included with your subscription and can be reached as support@chef.io
2016-09-06 15:59:58	emachnic	Thanks coderanger
2016-09-06 15:59:59	wedgie	that is, the one that is notified from several resources needs to run last
2016-09-06 16:00:03	@coderanger	wedgie: They run in the order stated in the file?
2016-09-06 16:00:41	@coderanger	wedgie: Like notifications are just an array (well, three arrays)
2016-09-06 16:01:08	wedgie	coderanger: well, it seems that Resource1 runs, notifies Resource2 (which then runs), then Resource3 also notifies Resource2, but Resource2 has already run and doesn't again
2016-09-06 16:01:17	wedgie	at least that is how it seems from chef-client output

2016-09-06 16:01:54	@coderanger	So yeah, it will only do it once

2016-09-06 16:02:11	wedgie	yeah, and that is fine, as long as Resource2 runs after the others have finished
2016-09-06 16:02:38	@coderanger	Delayed notifications happen at the end of the converge
2016-09-06 16:02:46	@coderanger	So the things that generated the notifications are all long over
2016-09-06 16:02:57	wedgie	hmm, so maybe i should make Resource1 and Resource3 immediate
2016-09-06 16:03:11	wedgie	that would ensure that they ran first, yes?
2016-09-06 16:03:16	@coderanger	In general if you are in a place where you want a "lastiest last", you've already done something wrong
2016-09-06 16:03:23	wedgie	(they are themselves triggered by a notify)
2016-09-06 16:03:32	@coderanger	Yeah, don't do that.
2016-09-06 16:03:34	wedgie	hmm
2016-09-06 16:03:38	@coderanger	Rewrite your code to be convergent
2016-09-06 16:03:50	@coderanger	Not a chain of procedural steps run by chaining notifications
2016-09-06 16:03:55	@cheeseplus	^
2016-09-06 16:03:55	@coderanger	Down that path lies only pain
2016-09-06 16:04:11	wedgie	ok, i'll have to think on how to best implement this then.
2016-09-06 16:05:05	@coderanger	Sometimes the best approach is to write a custom resource where the provider is some old fashioned Ruby code (using `shell_out!()` usually)
2016-09-06 16:05:17	@coderanger	And control ordering and sequencing manually via linear code
2016-09-06 16:05:42	@coderanger	That is still not wonderful, but the world is not always convergent and that is at least a lot more readable than a notification chain
2016-09-06 16:06:36	wedgie	in general i'm looking to run command1 if an attribute is 'true', command2 otherwise (in execute resources)
2016-09-06 16:07:01	@coderanger	Where is that attribute coming from?
2016-09-06 16:07:03	wedgie	and then comman3 at the end of all that
2016-09-06 16:07:19	wedgie	cookbook attributes

2016-09-06 16:08:16	@coderanger	No notifications needed
2016-09-06 16:10:04	wedgie	and that is idempotent? Changing the attribute from true to false (and vice versa) represents a state change on the system. So I only want to execute that when it changes. To accomplish that i was changing a file on the system and using that even to send the notifies (and this is where i think this went off the rails)
2016-09-06 16:10:24	@coderanger	That isn't what you said before :P
2016-09-06 16:10:44	wedgie	was trying to be too general, i guess :P
2016-09-06 16:10:45	@coderanger	And yeah, that would be more complex, probably in "write a custom resource" territory
2016-09-06 16:17:20	wedgie	ok, thanks for the input. I'll have to mull this over a bit :)
2016-09-06 16:28:06	ParsectiX	Guys what software inspec needs on the target host ? Can I used against legacy HW like switches ?
2016-09-06 16:30:01	@cheeseplus	ParsectiX: it needs ssh
2016-09-06 16:30:03	@cheeseplus	or winrm
2016-09-06 16:30:06	@cheeseplus	that's pretty much it
2016-09-06 16:30:49	@cheeseplus	there have been requests for things like telnet and SNMP, but it would be fairly easy to extend inspec for switches that allow ssh

2016-09-06 17:38:46	potatoes_	so I'm having an issue with the Filbeat recipe, when I run a chef-client on my node it complains that the resource or method 'powershell' is missing, this is exceedingly odd seeing as how I can see that the cookbook has been fetched and is installed, and furthermore is set as a dependency inside the Cookbook...
2016-09-06 17:38:55	potatoes_	any suggestions on how I can narrow down the real issue?

2016-09-06 18:04:24	structurefall	I have an RPM to install via the package resource, however the RPM itself isn’t available from a yum repo- it’s sitting on S3. I only want to download the file from S3 if the RPM is NOT already installed.

2016-09-06 18:05:22	potatoes_	which is OK in our environment cause we aren't using any Windows machines so I figure it shouldn't be a problem.
2016-09-06 18:05:24	structurefall	So I have a few options: one would be to do a begin/rescue block where the first is a normal package resource that I’m basically just using to check the install, and the rescue block gets the file and runs the package resource again
2016-09-06 18:05:27	@coderanger	potatoes_: Yeah, that's one way, but it should be fixed ASAP
2016-09-06 18:05:33	potatoes_	coderanger, ya

2016-09-06 18:06:02	structurefall	Another is to use the shell to check the RPM database, but that creates an awkward order of operations issue
2016-09-06 18:06:26	structurefall	Plus I just hate going out to the shell
2016-09-06 18:06:31	@coderanger	structurefall: remote_file 'asdf' do not_if 'rpm -q whatever'; notifies :install, 'package[whatever]', :immediately end
2016-09-06 18:06:49	structurefall	…aha
2016-09-06 18:07:02	@coderanger	structurefall: But probably just use a normal remote_file (or s3_file) and notifications
2016-09-06 18:07:14	@coderanger	You'll burn the disk space of storing the RPM even though you don't need to
2016-09-06 18:07:17	@coderanger	but it makes life easier
2016-09-06 18:07:27	@coderanger	Also disk space is cheap
2016-09-06 18:07:55	structurefall	I feel like last time I looked into s3_file I didn’t like it for whatever stupid reason. I’ve just been using the aws-sdk gem for s3 stuff, which has been fine...
2016-09-06 18:08:09	structurefall	And I could still use this technique with that I think

2016-09-06 20:42:23	structurefall	[18:03:03] Hi guys. I have a question with many possible answers, wanted to see what people think.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	structurefall	[18:04:24] I have an RPM to install via the package resource, however the RPM itself isn’t available from a yum repo- it’s sitting on S3. I only want to download the file from S3 if the RPM is NOT already installed.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	potatoes_	[18:05:03] coderanger: i found a crappy way to fix it
2016-09-06 20:42:23	potatoes_	[18:05:10] coderanger: I ended up pinning an older version of powershelgl :)
2016-09-06 20:42:23	potatoes_	[18:05:22] which is OK in our environment cause we aren't using any Windows machines so I figure it shouldn't be a problem.
2016-09-06 20:42:23	structurefall	[18:05:24] So I have a few options: one would be to do a begin/rescue block where the first is a normal package resource that I’m basically just using to check the install, and the rescue block gets the file and runs the package resource again
2016-09-06 20:42:23	@coderanger	[18:05:27] potatoes_: Yeah, that's one way, but it should be fixed ASAP
2016-09-06 20:42:23	potatoes_	[18:05:33] coderanger, ya

2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:41:36] Yeah, I think that's just incorrect code
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:41:54] It should be powershell_script
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:42:02] Maybe we used to alias it?

2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:42:35] https://github.com/vkhatri/chef-filebeat/issues/64
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:42:40] Already an open issue
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[17:43:29] ah
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[17:43:31] how do I fix this
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[17:43:34] whats the best way to fix it
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:43:44] potatoes_: You fork the cookbook and fix the code?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:43:57] Or I guess you can backrev the powershell cookbook
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:44:06] via an environment constraint or a wrapper cookbook
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[17:44:20] strange i didn't uncover this in dev
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[17:44:24] when i was running my own wrapper the other day ;P
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:44:56] You might have an older version of the powershell cookbook locally
2016-09-07 02:15:22	_Embalmed	[17:47:00] yeah looks like powershell pulled that resource sept 2nd
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:50:00] this is why you should use semver in dependencies :)
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[17:50:13] It would have at least warned you about the lack of compat :)
2016-09-07 02:15:22	structurefall	[18:03:03] Hi guys. I have a question with many possible answers, wanted to see what people think.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	structurefall	[18:04:24] I have an RPM to install via the package resource, however the RPM itself isn’t available from a yum repo- it’s sitting on S3. I only want to download the file from S3 if the RPM is NOT already installed.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[18:05:03] coderanger: i found a crappy way to fix it
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[18:05:10] coderanger: I ended up pinning an older version of powershelgl :)
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[18:05:22] which is OK in our environment cause we aren't using any Windows machines so I figure it shouldn't be a problem.
2016-09-07 02:15:22	structurefall	[18:05:24] So I have a few options: one would be to do a begin/rescue block where the first is a normal package resource that I’m basically just using to check the install, and the rescue block gets the file and runs the package resource again
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[18:05:27] potatoes_: Yeah, that's one way, but it should be fixed ASAP
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[18:05:33] coderanger, ya
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[18:05:37] hope so
2016-09-07 02:15:22	potatoes_	[18:05:39] kinda a big bug
2016-09-07 02:15:22	structurefall	[18:06:02] Another is to use the shell to check the RPM database, but that creates an awkward order of operations issue
2016-09-07 02:15:22	structurefall	[18:06:26] Plus I just hate going out to the shell
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[18:06:31] structurefall: remote_file 'asdf' do not_if 'rpm -q whatever'; notifies :install, 'package[whatever]', :immediately end
2016-09-07 02:15:22	structurefall	[18:06:49] …aha
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[18:07:02] structurefall: But probably just use a normal remote_file (or s3_file) and notifications
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[18:07:14] You'll burn the disk space of storing the RPM even though you don't need to
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[18:07:17] but it makes life easier
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[18:07:27] Also disk space is cheap
2016-09-07 02:15:22	structurefall	[18:07:55] I feel like last time I looked into s3_file I didn’t like it for whatever stupid reason. I’ve just been using the aws-sdk gem for s3 stuff, which has been fine...
2016-09-07 02:15:22	structurefall	[18:08:09] And I could still use this technique with that I think
2016-09-07 02:15:22	fletchowns	[19:37:36] occasionally test-kitchen will bomb out early in the converge: https://gist.github.com/fletchowns/d460245dd9eefbeacf3f70bed9884804
2016-09-07 02:15:22	fletchowns	[19:37:44] i usually just destroy and then run it again and it seems to work
2016-09-07 02:15:22	fletchowns	[19:38:00] worth filing a bug?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	fletchowns	[19:39:02] soemtimes i'll even have to go in and delete AppData/Local/Temp/myorg-jenkins... to get it working again
2016-09-07 02:15:22	fletchowns	[19:57:43] my stack trace looks very similar to this one: https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/issues/1052
2016-09-07 02:15:22	@coderanger	[00:59:08] Anyone around that has an account on the Chef discourse but isn't a mod?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	dc`	[01:56:23] provisioning w/ vagrant and aws. my recipe is picking up old attributes. what might the culprit be?
2016-09-07 02:15:22	dc`	[01:57:07] the compiled resource does not match the declaration
2016-09-07 02:15:22	stephenh	[02:14:55] Morning - just to check, it's not possible to test a notified resource will be executed with ChefSpec right?

2016-09-07 02:22:40	stephenh	not sure how to phrase this this question, but is it possible to for to populate resource attributes from existing data?  e.g. I have a config file, I have a template that writes that config file, is it possible to read existing data in config file to populate undefined attributes?
2016-09-07 02:24:31	stephenh	E.g. the config file has ipaddress=1.1.1.1, mask=255.255.255.0, gateway=0.0.0.0... Is it possible to set only the ipaddress value in the resource and it reads back the mask and gateway values instead of writing empty values to the file?
2016-09-07 02:24:42	@coderanger	You wouldn't use attributes, you would usually make a custom resource and define a load_current_values which does that
2016-09-07 02:24:54	@coderanger	Which is the core model of Chef
2016-09-07 02:25:14	@coderanger	Gather info about the current state of X, compared to the desired state of X, perform some actions to make one match the other
2016-09-07 02:25:20	stephenh	I meant attributes of a custom resource by "resource attributes)
2016-09-07 02:25:31	stephenh	I see, because that would be great
2016-09-07 02:26:12	@coderanger	We now call those properties for avoid confusion :)

2016-09-07 09:43:19	structurefall	[18:06:49] …aha
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[18:07:02] structurefall: But probably just use a normal remote_file (or s3_file) and notifications
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[18:07:14] You'll burn the disk space of storing the RPM even though you don't need to
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[18:07:17] but it makes life easier
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[18:07:27] Also disk space is cheap
2016-09-07 09:43:19	structurefall	[18:07:55] I feel like last time I looked into s3_file I didn’t like it for whatever stupid reason. I’ve just been using the aws-sdk gem for s3 stuff, which has been fine...
2016-09-07 09:43:19	structurefall	[18:08:09] And I could still use this technique with that I think
2016-09-07 09:43:19	fletchowns	[19:37:36] occasionally test-kitchen will bomb out early in the converge: https://gist.github.com/fletchowns/d460245dd9eefbeacf3f70bed9884804
2016-09-07 09:43:19	fletchowns	[19:37:44] i usually just destroy and then run it again and it seems to work
2016-09-07 09:43:19	fletchowns	[19:38:00] worth filing a bug?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	fletchowns	[19:39:02] soemtimes i'll even have to go in and delete AppData/Local/Temp/myorg-jenkins... to get it working again
2016-09-07 09:43:19	fletchowns	[19:57:43] my stack trace looks very similar to this one: https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/issues/1052
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[00:59:08] Anyone around that has an account on the Chef discourse but isn't a mod?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	dc`	[01:56:23] provisioning w/ vagrant and aws. my recipe is picking up old attributes. what might the culprit be?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	dc`	[01:57:07] the compiled resource does not match the declaration
2016-09-07 09:43:19	stephenh	[02:14:55] Morning - just to check, it's not possible to test a notified resource will be executed with ChefSpec right?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	stephenh	[02:15:15] coderanger: I have an account
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[02:16:10] stephenh: I got it sorted, thanks
2016-09-07 09:43:19	stephenh	[02:16:55] coderanger: okie dokes
2016-09-07 09:43:19	stephenh	[02:22:40] not sure how to phrase this this question, but is it possible to for to populate resource attributes from existing data?  e.g. I have a config file, I have a template that writes that config file, is it possible to read existing data in config file to populate undefined attributes?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	stephenh	[02:24:31] E.g. the config file has ipaddress=1.1.1.1, mask=255.255.255.0, gateway=0.0.0.0... Is it possible to set only the ipaddress value in the resource and it reads back the mask and gateway values instead of writing empty values to the file?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[02:24:42] You wouldn't use attributes, you would usually make a custom resource and define a load_current_values which does that
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[02:24:54] Which is the core model of Chef
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[02:25:14] Gather info about the current state of X, compared to the desired state of X, perform some actions to make one match the other
2016-09-07 09:43:19	stephenh	[02:25:20] I meant attributes of a custom resource by "resource attributes)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	stephenh	[02:25:31] I see, because that would be great
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@coderanger	[02:26:12] We now call those properties for avoid confusion :)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	shadowmtl2000	[08:30:25] hi
2016-09-07 09:43:19	chef838	[08:58:21] Hello. I am pretty new to Chef, but here's my question anyways: Package resources do nothing when the package is already installed, correct? Where in the Chef code is this logic? And is it possible to implement something similar in custom resources? My use case is I have a custom resource with a few execute resources and an eventual package resource, and I want nothing to happen when the package is already present. Thanks.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	shadowmtl2000	[09:02:38] is there an easy way to store the output of a provider in a variable IE. I call a provider that should return an array
2016-09-07 09:43:19	shadowmtl2000	[09:02:49] then I want to do something with that array later
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Scroff	[09:32:25] In a recipe, is it possible to get a hash of the attributes that are applied directly to a node (i.e. from doing something like 'knife node edit ...' rather than from environments/cookbooks/roles etc)?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:35:01] chef838: so that is the resource code just like a custom resource, it just happens to live in the chef repo
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:35:07] there is fundamentally no real difference
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:35:24] you can reuse resource inside custom resources so yes, that is possible
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:36:03] shadowmtl2000: not really, the resources should handle that stuff themselves
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:36:30] you can stash stuff in run_state but that's just a temp hash for stashing stuff for re-use
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:37:40] Scroff: not sure what you mean - in the context of a recipe, that's all merged down to node - what are you trying to achieve here?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	Scroff	[09:38:20] I'm trying to move a node to a different chef org
2016-09-07 09:43:19	chef838	[09:38:39] cheeseplus: I am reusing resources inside the custom resource, yes. If my resource was named custompkg, and in my recipe I do custompkg 'some_name', Can I have the custompkg do nothing if 'some_name' is present?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:39:13] I mean that is just flow control so yes?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	chef838	[09:39:28] Okay -- I'm missing something then. Sorry & thanks for your help.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:39:48] there are guards that are common to all resources, not_if and only_if
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:40:23] resources are supposed to be written to be idempotent and convergent - if they aren't then you end up having to use guards to control the idempotentcy
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:40:57] package, the resource, will not install a package if it is present if the action is install (default)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	chef838	[09:42:29] Okay, the custom resource has an execute, a ruby block, and a package resource. So I should create my own not_if's for each of those resources?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	chef838	[09:42:48] With my not knowing I was hoping there was a global "dont do anything in this custom resource if this is true" type thing
2016-09-07 09:43:19	@cheeseplus	[09:43:00] well execute and ruby_block are exemplars of resources that let you break idempotency
2016-09-07 09:43:19	chef838	[09:43:07] I wouldn't have to create a not_if for package, sorry*
2016-09-07 09:43:19	***	Playback Complete.
2016-09-07 09:43:23	@cheeseplus	chef838: so a custom resource should only act if it needs to change a thing
2016-09-07 09:43:28	@cheeseplus	that is something kind of built-in

2016-09-07 09:46:36	chef838	Okay -- I'll take a look at those. My reason for asking is my recipe, which is using my custom resource, has a notifies to some other resource, and if I understand correctly the notification only happens on a state change.. running the custom resource doesn't actually do "anything" in the second case, as it shouldn't, but the notifies still triggers the other resource. I'll dig into this now, thanks.
2016-09-07 09:47:21	@cheeseplus	so regardless of if the custom resource does anything, if it thinks it did something then the notification will fire
2016-09-07 09:47:42	chef838	Yeah so I'm trying to figure out how to get it to stop thinking it did something
2016-09-07 09:48:01	@cheeseplus	that's what those docs will help with precisely

2016-09-07 09:59:44	chef838	So there should be some package present check inside of load_current_value and the rest of the code should be in the converge_if_changed? That example makes sense but I'm having trouble applying it to my use case.

2016-09-07 10:01:52	@cheeseplus	so the thing is package does that itself already, so you shouldn't need to check the presence of a package again
2016-09-07 10:02:50	@cheeseplus	so yes, you can do that
2016-09-07 10:03:13	@cheeseplus	your action, like :install would have a converge_if_changed block
2016-09-07 10:03:21	chef838	package does that for itself, right? The custom resource that uses ruby blocks and does executes and stuff can't take advantage of package's built in check for that
2016-09-07 10:03:44	@cheeseplus	sure but I'm part questioning why it's a custom resource in that case as well
2016-09-07 10:04:29	@cheeseplus	so I was giving an answer to the immediate question but opinions on the design
2016-09-07 10:04:38	chef838	Oh okay -- the custom resource is actually a remote_file, followed by an execute that does an unzip, followed by some glob path ruby magic to find the specified .exe, then a package resource. The use case is we have to use Chef in a system with no access to the internet, and everything is pointing to a .zip on Artifactory.
2016-09-07 10:05:15	chef838	If the design is bogus feel free to tell me that, I've been largely thrown into Chef because nobody else is capable around here, lol.

2016-09-07 10:06:20	chef838	and how does sharing take place? Was hoping sharing a resource was possible/better
2016-09-07 10:06:28	@cheeseplus	at least I'm not sure if a custom resource buys you anything but that is probably implementation specific
2016-09-07 10:06:37	@cheeseplus	well it can be
2016-09-07 10:07:43	@cheeseplus	but it depends on the level of the team, one's understanding of chef, and the whether the cognitive load of writing the resource outweighs the clarity of a recipe
2016-09-07 10:08:12	@cheeseplus	if you need to re-use something in lots of other wrapper cookbooks, a resource makes sense
2016-09-07 10:08:38	@cheeseplus	so if this is a common way to install packages, then go nuts
2016-09-07 10:08:44	chef838	Yep that's it
2016-09-07 10:08:53	@cheeseplus	now the fact it's an exe means detecting that it's installed is a crapshoot
2016-09-07 10:09:09	@cheeseplus	windows lacks what one would call a package manager
2016-09-07 10:09:22	chef838	The OneGet resource works pretty well

2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[13:59:09] There should be more error output
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[13:59:20] Like a stack trace
2016-09-07 17:22:11	crlane	[14:01:31] the part that has the resource declaration, compiled resource, etc?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:02:49] Yes
2016-09-07 17:22:11	crlane	[14:06:39] http://pastebin.com/R0e9EnF5
2016-09-07 17:22:11	crlane	[14:06:54] Pulled from the kitchen vagrant instance log
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:10:34] So yeah, that's almost certainly the data bag
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:10:39] did you create it?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	crlane	[14:10:55] I did using knife data bag create users blah
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:11:07] that has no bearing on Test Kitchen
2016-09-07 17:22:11	crlane	[14:11:10] probably put a -z
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:11:13] You need to set up test fixture data
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:12:39] i.e. put the files under test/integration/data_bag (I think, its been a while)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	crlane	[14:14:16] Ah! yeah, it makes perfect sense now that you mention it. Data bags live at the chef repo level of the directory structure, not the cookbook level. Seems obvious now. Cool - I think this gives me enough to get the rest of the way on my own. Thanks so much coderanger!
2016-09-07 17:22:11	crlane	[14:19:56] @coderanger: turns out I can just point to the data bags in the kitchen.yml file. :|
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:20:19] Doable, but not recommended. Use a reduced test fixture set
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:20:31] Otherwise you'll have to update your tests as production data changes
2016-09-07 17:22:11	crlane	[14:21:56] Good point.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	TheJeff_	[14:29:38] ole
2016-09-07 17:22:11	TheJeff_	[14:29:50] any way to make a test sleep prior to running with inspec?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	TheJeff_	[14:30:29] getting failures curl'ing for content, but passes when checked manually a few minutes later via kitchen login && curl localhost
2016-09-07 17:22:11	TheJeff_	[14:31:39] whats the best practice there?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:32:46] TheJeff_: Fix your recipes to not finish until they do what they are supposed to
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:33:00] If the goal of a recipe is to ensure a service is running, then wait for it
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:33:17] Otherwise you'll get the same issue when later recipes are trying to use something from that service
2016-09-07 17:22:11	TheJeff_	[14:33:32] hm... good thought
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:33:33] This usually means a ruby_block with a while loop and some kind of check
2016-09-07 17:22:11	TheJeff_	[14:34:12] its a deploy recipe that clones a repo and deploys some npm things, problem is our rails takes a sec
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ag4ve_	[14:34:59] is there a way to put a default environment in knife.rb so I don't have to do -E when bootstrapping?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:35:28] ag4ve_: You can set defaults for all knife comamnds via knife[:option] = value
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:35:32] in the config file
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ag4ve_	[14:37:50] So knife[:chef_environment] should DWIW?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	TheJeff_	[14:38:06] coderanger: efficient example of such a ruby_block?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	TheJeff_	[14:38:12] kinda a ruby noob
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:38:27] ag4ve_: Double check the option name, but yeah
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:38:35] ag4ve_: Also remember it applies to _all_ knife commands
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:38:48] TheJeff_: Sorry, no time
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ag4ve_	[14:39:04] dig it
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ag4ve_	[14:39:20] it's not documented...
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@coderanger	[14:39:41] Indeed, needx to check code

2016-09-07 17:22:11	ag4ve_	[14:46:13] hmm maybe it is just environment (gets assigned to chef_environment inside knife)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	northrup	[15:02:38] is there an easier way of assigning admins to chef-vault secrets than individually naming them?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	phutchins	[15:03:04] hey Dylan :)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	cloudbud	[15:06:29] is inspec part of chef environment or we can also work without that /
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@cheeseplus	[15:10:31] not sure what you're asking
2016-09-07 17:22:11	@cheeseplus	[15:10:36] inspec is it's own thing

2016-09-07 21:02:38	@coderanger	[17:48:56] fletchowns: You don't seem to have a dep on the handler cookbook?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	fletchowns	[17:52:32] hmm you seem to be correct! now i'm wondering how this thing ever worked in the first place. thanks!
2016-09-07 21:02:38	@coderanger	[18:35:23] Might have been getting pulled in to your depgraph elsewhere.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	fletchowns	[18:45:33] i'm running into this one a bunch too: https://gist.github.com/fletchowns/dcb8d574c375b8ac8461f6626b7eac25#file-gistfile1-txt-L147
2016-09-07 21:02:38	fletchowns	[18:45:50] i'm guessing something to do with windows?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	fletchowns	[18:46:07] i've been doing `kitchen destroy` and clearing out C:/Users/GREGBA~1/AppData/Local/Temp/ to get around it
2016-09-07 21:02:38	@coderanger	[18:46:17] No idea
2016-09-07 21:02:38	fletchowns	[19:11:40] is the chef_config thing mentioned here what I should use to tell chef-provisioning to use my policy name & group? https://github.com/chef/chef-provisioning/issues/407

2016-09-08 10:38:49	TheJeff_	[14:29:38] ole
2016-09-08 10:38:49	TheJeff_	[14:29:50] any way to make a test sleep prior to running with inspec?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	TheJeff_	[14:30:29] getting failures curl'ing for content, but passes when checked manually a few minutes later via kitchen login && curl localhost
2016-09-08 10:38:49	TheJeff_	[14:31:39] whats the best practice there?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:32:46] TheJeff_: Fix your recipes to not finish until they do what they are supposed to
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:33:00] If the goal of a recipe is to ensure a service is running, then wait for it
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:33:17] Otherwise you'll get the same issue when later recipes are trying to use something from that service
2016-09-08 10:38:49	TheJeff_	[14:33:32] hm... good thought
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:33:33] This usually means a ruby_block with a while loop and some kind of check
2016-09-08 10:38:49	TheJeff_	[14:34:12] its a deploy recipe that clones a repo and deploys some npm things, problem is our rails takes a sec
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ag4ve_	[14:34:59] is there a way to put a default environment in knife.rb so I don't have to do -E when bootstrapping?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:35:28] ag4ve_: You can set defaults for all knife comamnds via knife[:option] = value
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:35:32] in the config file
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ag4ve_	[14:37:50] So knife[:chef_environment] should DWIW?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	TheJeff_	[14:38:06] coderanger: efficient example of such a ruby_block?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	TheJeff_	[14:38:12] kinda a ruby noob
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:38:27] ag4ve_: Double check the option name, but yeah
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:38:35] ag4ve_: Also remember it applies to _all_ knife commands
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:38:48] TheJeff_: Sorry, no time
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ag4ve_	[14:39:04] dig it
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ag4ve_	[14:39:20] it's not documented...
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[14:39:41] Indeed, needx to check code
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ag4ve_	[14:40:30] node_data_handler.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ag4ve_	[14:40:35] blah
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ag4ve_	[14:40:57] node_data_handler.rb looks right?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ag4ve_	[14:46:13] hmm maybe it is just environment (gets assigned to chef_environment inside knife)
2016-09-08 10:38:49	northrup	[15:02:38] is there an easier way of assigning admins to chef-vault secrets than individually naming them?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	phutchins	[15:03:04] hey Dylan :)
2016-09-08 10:38:49	cloudbud	[15:06:29] is inspec part of chef environment or we can also work without that /
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@cheeseplus	[15:10:31] not sure what you're asking
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@cheeseplus	[15:10:36] inspec is it's own thing

2016-09-08 10:38:49	fletchowns	[18:45:33] i'm running into this one a bunch too: https://gist.github.com/fletchowns/dcb8d574c375b8ac8461f6626b7eac25#file-gistfile1-txt-L147
2016-09-08 10:38:49	fletchowns	[18:45:50] i'm guessing something to do with windows?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	fletchowns	[18:46:07] i've been doing `kitchen destroy` and clearing out C:/Users/GREGBA~1/AppData/Local/Temp/ to get around it
2016-09-08 10:38:49	@coderanger	[18:46:17] No idea
2016-09-08 10:38:49	fletchowns	[19:11:40] is the chef_config thing mentioned here what I should use to tell chef-provisioning to use my policy name & group? https://github.com/chef/chef-provisioning/issues/407

2016-09-08 10:38:49	Philipp_	[04:35:20] is there a known problem with api.berkshelf.com?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Philipp_	[04:35:26] berks update takes forever
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Philipp_	[04:38:02] supermarket.chef.io seems to have the same problem
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Philipp_	[04:41:21] hmm maybe they are fine and the resolution process takes too long
2016-09-08 10:38:49	Philipp_	[04:41:36] what could be the reason for "The dependency constraints could not be solved in the time allotted."?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	joshmyers	[07:39:27] Is it possible to have Chef follow symlinks for data_bags?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	callen92	[08:12:41] Hi, I'm a chef n00b and have what is probably a very basic question, if I wanted to run a cookbook from the supermarket in a recipe, how would i do that, i tried to google the answer and came up short
2016-09-08 10:38:49	callen92	[08:14:57] oh wait, answered my question, nm

2016-09-08 16:12:36	EZtheOG	[13:51:52] ?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	svetzal	[14:16:16] Hey folks :) should I be able to reference templates from an LWRP library cookbook? This is killing me right now
2016-09-08 16:12:36	@cheeseplus	[14:23:55] sure, you can tell a template what cookbook to look in
2016-09-08 16:12:36	svetzal	[14:26:13] yeah the lwrp and templates are in a dependent cookbook, and I’m able to see the resource, but it couldn’t find its templates. I am just using the cookbook method in the base lwrp cookbook but it feels weird to have to specify for that template resource the cookbook that it already resides in (?)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	Guest91910	[14:28:08] Hi, is the supermarket down ? Berkshelf fails with this error:
2016-09-08 16:12:36	Guest91910	[14:28:10] Fetching cookbook index from https://supermarket.chef.io... The dependency constraints could not be solved in the time allotted.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	svetzal	[14:28:39] I was hitting it just a few minutes ago OK
2016-09-08 16:12:36	svetzal	[14:29:18] (assuming berks update hits it, I figured it ought to)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	Guest91910	[14:31:46] just tried with berks update and it took a while, but it worked. No luck with berks install (without a lock file)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	Guest91910	[14:32:21] oh, scratch that, this time it worked. I guess it was down for a few minutes
2016-09-08 16:12:36	svetzal	[14:38:32] OMG *hangs head* I accidentally left a template ref in the cookbook I was refactoring, whose template I’d already moved to the library cookbook O_o
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kgirthofer	[15:03:39] how do I upgrade the ruby version chef exec is using?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	@cheeseplus	[15:05:57] you don't really, you upgrade the DK
2016-09-08 16:12:36	@cheeseplus	[15:06:50] chef exec uses the internally bundled ruby, you shouldn't be mucking with that and if you were to want to do so you'd not really be using chef exec in the first place
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kgirthofer	[15:06:51] ah ok
2016-09-08 16:12:36	@cheeseplus	[15:07:23] you also don't have to use chef exec if you run the shell helper stuff
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kgirthofer	[15:09:25] I have a custom script that I run to create cookbooks - called initializecookbook - it runs through a bunch of stepper functions to create cookbooks exactly how I want. and it uses chef exec and there's a gem that needs ruby 2.2 and my chefdk uses 2.1
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kgirthofer	[15:09:29] all good - update is no problem
2016-09-08 16:12:36	@cheeseplus	[15:10:41] sure thing, we're going to ruby 2.3.1 next release
2016-09-08 16:12:36	@cheeseplus	[15:10:57] it's been a big thing
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kgirthofer	[15:13:37] nice!
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kgirthofer	[15:13:45] I haven't played in 2.3 yet
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kgirthofer	[15:15:58] whoa seems like I got 2.3
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kgirthofer	[15:16:00] on chefdk
2016-09-08 16:12:36	stephenh	[15:26:38] cheeseplus: ruby >2.1 would be fantastic.  any clue how far away that release is?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	stephenh	[15:27:02] also ran into issues with gems requiring newer version of ruby
2016-09-08 16:12:36	@cheeseplus	[15:27:23] may have already landed

2016-09-08 16:12:36	stephenh	[15:44:58] ubsrv: why would you need to?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ubsrv	[15:46:42] because I need to reload any service that is running from a list. I know I could subscribe the required resources to an action but that would involve a *lot* of work as things are right now
2016-09-08 16:12:36	techminer	[15:49:39] Anyone put chef-client on RHEL/CentOS Atomic?  Trying to figure out how to get it there without package management or build tools.

2016-09-08 16:46:24	ubsrv	stephenh: thing is I'll have a static list of services for all machines, which doesn't imply all machines have all of them installed, plus if one of these services exists and is not running, I don't want to reload them as it would fail; so the flow is: 1) check if service exists, 2) if not, don't do anything; 3) if yes, reload it only if it's running

2016-09-08 16:48:41	stephenh	ubsrv: the idea behind config management is to describe desired state, e.g. service should be running, if you want to selectively do things with conditions you better using an orchestration tool like ansible IMO
2016-09-08 16:50:51	pauzed	ubsrv: it -sounds- to me like you're trying to have a single recipe controlling lots of conditional services... why not split each of those services to their own recipes, and apply that recipe(s) to the run list of the desired nodes?

2016-09-08 18:10:18	maraca	Howdy, how do you guys deal with instance deregistration on ubuntu 16.04 and systemd? I used to be able to do it with upstart and init 0 but things seem to have change quite a lot since 12.04. Wondering if there is a recommended way to deregister a client on shutdown?

2016-09-08 18:11:42	pauzed	maraca: mace an rc script that would do it would be the best way.  otherwise ive just use knife (ex: knife ec2 server delete) to terminate an instance and clear its node/client from chef server
2016-09-08 18:12:37	maraca	@pauzed I used to do it with rc + upstart but since 16.04 is running using systemd I haven’t been able to quite reproduce that yet. Seems like that’s the direction to go though. Just have to figure out how to update those scripts i guess!

2016-09-08 18:15:27	pauzed	i think systemd just has a notion of start + stop, looks like the hacky way others are using it is by saying ExecStop is effectively the script you'd want to run on shutdown
2016-09-08 18:15:48	pauzed	but to me not overly the right way, since if you wanted to manually stop the service, you'd call some actions you didnt really want :|
2016-09-08 18:16:07	maraca	that’s a very good point ..

2016-09-09 09:48:10	troyready	[16:13:07] Probably other options too
2016-09-09 09:48:10	jtaylor_	[16:36:39] Is there a suggested workflow with chef + jenkins to ensure jenkins uploads everything in chef-repo to the server?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	SuperLag	[16:36:47] Any of you folks use knife-vmsphere?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	jtaylor_	[16:36:49] Only seems to upload cookbooks
2016-09-09 09:48:10	SuperLag	[16:38:53] How do you get knife to recognize plugins that are installed?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	stephenh	[16:39:28] SuperLag: can you "chef gem install <plugin gem>"
2016-09-09 09:48:10	stephenh	[16:39:31] can do*
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[16:40:57] i chuck my custom plugins into my ~/.chef/plugins/knife older
2016-09-09 09:48:10	stephenh	[16:43:42] ubsrv: if you define them and say you want them enabled and running ...?    e.g. http://hastebin.com/dibefuhaji.rb
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[16:45:20] jtaylor_: purportedly, you should be able to just do a knife cookbook upload ., but i dont personally do that.  we only upload our changed files, we dont try to do a full upload every time
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[16:45:37] jtaylor_: sorry, knife upload ., not knife cookbook
2016-09-09 09:48:10	jtaylor_	[16:46:01] pauzed: thanks for the response. The observed behaviour of 'knife upload .' only seems to upload cookbooks
2016-09-09 09:48:10	ubsrv	[16:46:24] stephenh: thing is I'll have a static list of services for all machines, which doesn't imply all machines have all of them installed, plus if one of these services exists and is not running, I don't want to reload them as it would fail; so the flow is: 1) check if service exists, 2) if not, don't do anything; 3) if yes, reload it only if it's running
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[16:48:06] jtaylor_: in your knife.rb, i presume that you have a cookbook_path defined.  maybe you need to defaine chef_repo_path as well?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	jtaylor_	[16:48:26] pauzed: I think you're onto something. I'll check that out. Thanks
2016-09-09 09:48:10	stephenh	[16:48:41] ubsrv: the idea behind config management is to describe desired state, e.g. service should be running, if you want to selectively do things with conditions you better using an orchestration tool like ansible IMO
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[16:50:51] ubsrv: it -sounds- to me like you're trying to have a single recipe controlling lots of conditional services... why not split each of those services to their own recipes, and apply that recipe(s) to the run list of the desired nodes?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[16:51:38] i agree with stephenh with regards to having an orchestration layer may make more sense if you require such situational things
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[16:54:01] otherwise, you could write your own custom resource that would encapsulate all of that logic for you
2016-09-09 09:48:10	ubsrv	[16:55:48] pauzed: indeed, and I know that's not the right way to go and this should be implemented per-recipe, however in this case it would imply a huge amount of work; I already have a custom resource but don't know how to check if a service is or not running
2016-09-09 09:48:10	stephenh	[17:00:20] service <name> status?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	ubsrv	[17:06:05] stephenh: it has to be platform independent as well, as we have debian-based OS, rhel based OS... :-(
2016-09-09 09:48:10	stephenh	[17:06:35] ubsrv: ansible supports different distros :-)
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[17:07:41] ubsrv: https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/service.rb
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[17:10:32] read through how the resource is handling it and see if you can extend your resource to support similar behaviour
2016-09-09 09:48:10	ubsrv	[17:10:57] looks interesting, thanks a lot guys!
2016-09-09 09:48:10	stephenh	[17:32:04] is there a less manual way to provision a chef server HA setup?  like a cookbook or suggested TF plan?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	maraca	[18:10:18] Howdy, how do you guys deal with instance deregistration on ubuntu 16.04 and systemd? I used to be able to do it with upstart and init 0 but things seem to have change quite a lot since 12.04. Wondering if there is a recommended way to deregister a client on shutdown?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[18:11:42] maraca: mace an rc script that would do it would be the best way.  otherwise ive just use knife (ex: knife ec2 server delete) to terminate an instance and clear its node/client from chef server
2016-09-09 09:48:10	maraca	[18:12:37] @pauzed I used to do it with rc + upstart but since 16.04 is running using systemd I haven’t been able to quite reproduce that yet. Seems like that’s the direction to go though. Just have to figure out how to update those scripts i guess!
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[18:15:27] i think systemd just has a notion of start + stop, looks like the hacky way others are using it is by saying ExecStop is effectively the script you'd want to run on shutdown
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[18:15:48] but to me not overly the right way, since if you wanted to manually stop the service, you'd call some actions you didnt really want :|
2016-09-09 09:48:10	maraca	[18:16:07] that’s a very good point ..
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[18:18:30] supposedly just chucking a script into /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/ would do the ticket
2016-09-09 09:48:10	pauzed	[18:18:46] im still running 14 on my infra tho, not well versed in systemd
2016-09-09 09:48:10	maraca	[18:20:28] pauzed: i’ll keep digging. thanks a lot for pointing me in the right direction
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Nick_ZWG	[23:08:23] I found one reference to this, but I can't find definitive evidence: is there a notification for resources based on success or failure?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Nick_ZWG	[23:08:41] i.e. if a resource fails, can I notify a different resource than if it succeeds?

2016-09-09 09:48:10	circ-user-ccfdw	[01:11:47] please forgive the n00b question, but is it acceptable/recommended/utterly stupid to bootstrap the Chef client on the Chef Server (and Automate server and Compliance server) so that it manages itself?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	valkyrka	[09:15:28] hi guys, I’m looking at https://docs.chef.io/resource_git.html and for the life of me I can’t seem to figure how to push code to GIT
2016-09-09 09:48:10	valkyrka	[09:16:08] I’ve written the following https://gist.github.com/anonymous/283d70f7f4f1e8ea829c460612077e29 which fetches the repo
2016-09-09 09:48:10	valkyrka	[09:16:35] but I can’t seem to figure out how to add that passwd file and push it to git
2016-09-09 09:48:10	valkyrka	[09:16:36] any ideas?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	srenatus[m]	[09:22:50] valkyrka: I'm afraid there's no push action to the git resource. but you could execute "git push ..." all you want, I'd say
2016-09-09 09:48:10	webframp	[09:22:52] valkyrka: the git resource doesn't have actions that support push to the remote repo: https://docs.chef.io/resource_git.html#actions
2016-09-09 09:48:10	webframp	[09:22:59] sorry
2016-09-09 09:48:10	valkyrka	[09:23:03] thanks a lot guys
2016-09-09 09:48:10	valkyrka	[09:23:22] I’ll do that, thought I’m missing something
2016-09-09 09:48:10	webframp	[09:30:46] valkyrka: if you really need that, an execute resource will do, will need a guard to be safe https://docs.chef.io/resources.html#guards

2016-09-09 16:47:11	valkyrka	[09:15:28] hi guys, I’m looking at https://docs.chef.io/resource_git.html and for the life of me I can’t seem to figure how to push code to GIT
2016-09-09 16:47:11	valkyrka	[09:16:08] I’ve written the following https://gist.github.com/anonymous/283d70f7f4f1e8ea829c460612077e29 which fetches the repo
2016-09-09 16:47:11	valkyrka	[09:16:35] but I can’t seem to figure out how to add that passwd file and push it to git

2016-09-09 16:47:11	srenatus[m]	[09:22:50] valkyrka: I'm afraid there's no push action to the git resource. but you could execute "git push ..." all you want, I'd say

2016-09-09 16:47:11	srenatus[m]	[11:35:31] `git commit -m passwd` will exit 1 if there's nothing staged (i.e. if `git add` was called on a file that hasn't changed), so `git push` won't happen and you get the exit code 1, which will make the execute block fail. if you append `|| echo "nothing to do"`, you'd probably be fine.

2016-09-09 16:47:11	shadowmtl2000	[14:04:35] i'm guessing it's a path issue or something ?
2016-09-09 16:47:11	@coderanger	[14:14:09] shadowmtl2000: That should be `time`
2016-09-09 16:47:11	@coderanger	[14:14:23] Windows is case-insensitive on paths, Linux is not
2016-09-09 16:47:11	@coderanger	[14:14:45] Ruby convention is that paths are all lower with underscores, class names are InitialCaps

2016-09-09 16:48:29	shadowmtl2000	[14:04:04] gives me a load error
2016-09-09 16:48:29	shadowmtl2000	[14:04:23] cannot load such file -- Time
2016-09-09 16:48:29	shadowmtl2000	[14:04:35] i'm guessing it's a path issue or something ?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	@coderanger	[14:14:09] shadowmtl2000: That should be `time`
2016-09-09 16:48:29	@coderanger	[14:14:23] Windows is case-insensitive on paths, Linux is not
2016-09-09 16:48:29	@coderanger	[14:14:45] Ruby convention is that paths are all lower with underscores, class names are InitialCaps
2016-09-09 16:48:29	shadowmtl2000	[14:19:07] ah nice
2016-09-09 16:48:29	shadowmtl2000	[14:19:13] thx dude i owe you one :D
2016-09-09 16:48:29	shadowmtl2000	[14:19:29] i always forget that about nix
2016-09-09 16:48:29	shadowmtl2000	[14:19:32] lol
2016-09-09 16:48:29	shadowmtl2000	[14:19:44] if i could buy you a beer i would :)
