2016-09-08 16:12:36	tmbg	[17:01:05] I hate the dgs interface so much
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kadoban	[17:04:18] Why?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tmbg	[17:06:40] it's just really clunky and 1990s. 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kadoban	[17:08:13] What's actually missing that you want to do though?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tmbg	[17:09:46] for one, being able to navigate forward back and forth in the game without having to click twice
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kadoban	[17:11:08] tmbg: Just use the eidogo link (for some reason has a "magnifying glass" icon), or download the SGF
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tmbg	[17:15:57] downloading an sgf just to be able to navigate the thing is sort of preposterous. 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kadoban	[17:20:31] Kinda, sorta. Practically it's "click once extra if you want to browse the game"
2016-09-08 16:12:36	izabera	[17:50:58] if you want a better interface just use kgs 
2016-09-08 16:12:36	izabera	[17:51:03] amirite?!
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tmbg	[17:58:27] izabera: OGS is what I was thinking of, actually :p
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tmbg	[17:58:34] particularly for correspondence
2016-09-08 16:12:36	dmwit	[18:10:17] kadoban: I miss conditional move support. And DGS' handling of text is atrocious (read: it handles bytes, not text).
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kadoban	[18:15:16] dmwit: Yes, both of those are annoying. jug seems to be hung up on not being able to switch to utf-8 or something sane without potentially breaking old text, but ... bleh, just do it already.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	dmwit	[18:17:09] agreed
2016-09-08 16:12:36	kadoban	[18:21:04] The conditional move thing ... I think that just requires work. Probably requires the JS board thing first too.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	dmwit	[18:36:25] I had a tool for a while that let me just download all my games as SGFs and save them, and it would sit and poll DGS to play my moves when my opponent responded.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	dmwit	[18:36:36] But the DGS API changed and I never had the energy to go back and fix it up.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	dmwit	[18:37:06] Anyway, the upshot of this comment is that I would be fine if DGS didn't have a GUI for conditional moves, and just let me upload an SGF.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	izabera	[19:58:32] how do i access tygem from linux?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tmbg	[19:59:11] wine maybe? I've never tried though
2016-09-08 16:12:36	izabera	[19:59:16] i don't even know how to download the client
2016-09-08 16:12:36	izabera	[19:59:22] haven't found it yet on their site
2016-09-08 16:12:36	tmbg	[20:01:46] probably an adblock blocking it. the googles tell me it's at http://download2.tygembaduk.com/down_tygem/setup/TygemGlobalSetup.exe

2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[17:01:05] I hate the dgs interface so much
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[17:04:18] Why?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[17:06:40] it's just really clunky and 1990s. 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[17:08:13] What's actually missing that you want to do though?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[17:09:46] for one, being able to navigate forward back and forth in the game without having to click twice
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[17:11:08] tmbg: Just use the eidogo link (for some reason has a "magnifying glass" icon), or download the SGF
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[17:15:57] downloading an sgf just to be able to navigate the thing is sort of preposterous. 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[17:20:31] Kinda, sorta. Practically it's "click once extra if you want to browse the game"
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[17:50:58] if you want a better interface just use kgs 
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[17:51:03] amirite?!
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[17:58:27] izabera: OGS is what I was thinking of, actually :p
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[17:58:34] particularly for correspondence
2016-09-09 09:48:10	dmwit	[18:10:17] kadoban: I miss conditional move support. And DGS' handling of text is atrocious (read: it handles bytes, not text).
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[18:15:16] dmwit: Yes, both of those are annoying. jug seems to be hung up on not being able to switch to utf-8 or something sane without potentially breaking old text, but ... bleh, just do it already.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	dmwit	[18:17:09] agreed
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[18:21:04] The conditional move thing ... I think that just requires work. Probably requires the JS board thing first too.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	dmwit	[18:36:25] I had a tool for a while that let me just download all my games as SGFs and save them, and it would sit and poll DGS to play my moves when my opponent responded.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	dmwit	[18:36:36] But the DGS API changed and I never had the energy to go back and fix it up.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	dmwit	[18:37:06] Anyway, the upshot of this comment is that I would be fine if DGS didn't have a GUI for conditional moves, and just let me upload an SGF.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[19:58:32] how do i access tygem from linux?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[19:59:11] wine maybe? I've never tried though
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[19:59:16] i don't even know how to download the client
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[19:59:22] haven't found it yet on their site
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[20:01:46] probably an adblock blocking it. the googles tell me it's at http://download2.tygembaduk.com/down_tygem/setup/TygemGlobalSetup.exe
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[20:05:33] thank you
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[20:09:02] np
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[20:22:13] installation with wine is proving to be non trivial
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[20:24:41] izabera: If it helps, wbaduk works out of the box in wine, and can give you what I think is a fairly similar player-base to tygem.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[20:50:11] it worked :)
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[21:34:47] yay
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[21:35:03] which one worked? wine>
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[21:35:05] ?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[21:41:13] wine + tygem
2016-09-09 09:48:10	tmbg	[21:44:29] Yay.
2016-09-09 09:48:10	Zharf	[09:22:37] there's so much death and destruction on ogs
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[11:07:56] Oh boy, I think my opponent let me live. Maybe
2016-09-09 09:48:10	sdrodge	[12:57:19] kadobansGroup :: Maybe AliveGroup
2016-09-09 09:48:10	kadoban	[12:58:09] Indeed
2016-09-09 09:48:10	izabera	[12:58:23] is that haskell?
2016-09-09 09:48:10	sdrodge	[12:58:28] yep
