2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:50:20] no, there are two cool things about docker - a) layered filesystem which means if you structure your images properly, you'll need to pull kilobytes instead of gigabytes if the the only thing that have changed is source code
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:50:43] ok
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:50:44] and b) that if you build a container and it works now, it will work in future 100%
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:51:31] you're putting everything needed in a container and you just don't care which programming language is used, which dependency manager for that language is used, where are configuration files located etc
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:51:42] so then my problems would be outside container? ( If I didnt misconfigure something inside structure packed in container ofcourse )
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:51:52] yes
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:52:25] the point is, you can't just ssh into a running container (unless you build it with ssh) and break the whole system
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:52:39] even if you can do that, the rollback is simple - just stop and start the container again
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:52:51] ok
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:52:58] Im starting to get an image
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:53:11] It provides isolation
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:53:27] docker is not silver bullet, but it definitely has its pros
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:53:59] (and i'm not talking about mesos/maraphon/other shit to manage docker containers, i'm pretty happy with aws ecs and terraform)
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:54:05] Im just asking coz Im very sceptic when I see projects adding another layers of abstraction
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:54:33] and what are downsides of docker?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:54:41] for hosting things
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:55:45] it doesn't work as smoothly as virtualbox in terms of local environment, osx and windows are still guests on that party
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:56:12] if you don't structure your images properly, you'll end up with unnecessary gigabytes of traffic
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[02:56:40] if you don't monitor your servers that run docker engine, you'll end up with disk full of stale images
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[02:57:09] is there a point in using docker inside VM installation provisioned by ansible?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[03:00:22] [11:01] <malinoff> if you don't structure your images properly, you'll end up with unnecessary gigabytes of traffic
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[03:00:29] what is an example of such disaster?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[03:02:37] industrialized: https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/#/images-and-layers
2016-09-01 14:20:32	sys_stupid	[03:02:38] [ Understand images, containers, and storage drivers ] - docs.docker.com
2016-09-01 14:20:32	malinoff	[03:03:17] industrialized: disaster is when you don't cache any layer (except for the base one) and re-build everything from scratch every time you make any change no matter what
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[03:46:03] Is there any sense to use grsec+PAX for virtual machines systems?
2016-09-01 14:20:32	industrialized	[03:46:56] I mean for kernels insid vm, not on server hosting VMS
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:21:40] geggam: ah I think what you missed was:

2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:22:15] stupid terminal
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:22:17] what even is that
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:22:42] so eh..
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:22:43] --
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:22:48] 00:30 < tinco> geggam: yes we make money, and we actually haven't encountered any of the big bugs people talk about
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:22:51] 00:30 < tinco> but in those 3 years we've maybe upgraded docker 2 or 3 times
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:22:53] 00:30 < tinco> so perhaps we just haven't run the buggy releases
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:23:11] that's what I meant to paste
2016-09-01 14:20:32	tinco	[06:26:44] apparently kde saves your clipboard across reboots, that garbage was from a reddit thread I read yesterday :P

2016-09-02 14:13:21	malinoff	[02:55:45] it doesn't work as smoothly as virtualbox in terms of local environment, osx and windows are still guests on that party
2016-09-02 14:13:21	malinoff	[02:56:12] if you don't structure your images properly, you'll end up with unnecessary gigabytes of traffic
2016-09-02 14:13:21	malinoff	[02:56:40] if you don't monitor your servers that run docker engine, you'll end up with disk full of stale images
2016-09-02 14:13:21	industrialized	[02:57:09] is there a point in using docker inside VM installation provisioned by ansible?

2016-09-02 14:13:21	industrialized	[03:46:03] Is there any sense to use grsec+PAX for virtual machines systems?
2016-09-02 14:13:21	industrialized	[03:46:56] I mean for kernels insid vm, not on server hosting VMS

2016-09-02 14:13:21	tinco	[06:22:51] 00:30 < tinco> but in those 3 years we've maybe upgraded docker 2 or 3 times
2016-09-02 14:13:21	tinco	[06:22:53] 00:30 < tinco> so perhaps we just haven't run the buggy releases

2016-09-02 14:13:21	tinco	[06:26:44] apparently kde saves your clipboard across reboots, that garbage was from a reddit thread I read yesterday :P

2016-09-02 14:13:21	Naypalm	[15:14:39] pretty much steps you through it
2016-09-02 14:13:21	Naypalm	[15:14:54] if they want their own MTA then fire up Exim somewhere, it's not *that* complex
2016-09-02 14:13:21	moritz	[15:17:55] well, sending emails can be a PITA, because of spam filters and such

2016-09-05 21:58:39	djboz	[14:50:02] They got their name through GoDaddy, any recommendation on what type of mail system I can advise them on?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Naypalm	[15:14:35] well for a gmail like feel just use google apps
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Naypalm	[15:14:39] pretty much steps you through it
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Naypalm	[15:14:54] if they want their own MTA then fire up Exim somewhere, it's not *that* complex
2016-09-05 21:58:39	moritz	[15:17:55] well, sending emails can be a PITA, because of spam filters and such
2016-09-05 21:58:39	f3ew	[05:43:39] Can you outsource the problem to Google/Microsoft ?

2016-09-05 21:58:39	martman	[22:31:26] im trying to wrap my head around creating a nice setup using AWS. im currently using gitlab (with CI) and redmine. i see amazon offers some useful sounding stuff like codepipeline and im not sure how that can or should fit in
2016-09-05 21:58:39	martman	[22:31:58] is this a replacement for gitlabs functionality?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	martman	[22:32:18] i like gitlab, so i dont want to replace it any way really

2016-09-05 21:58:39	Yumonra	[04:19:44] i always get lost when thinking about logging. is there any good resources/books about this topic?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Yumonra	[04:19:53] there are subjects like security, performance, sufficiency, storage, analysis, notifications, semantics
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Yumonra	[04:20:13] i think logging is one of the hardest things to get right while programming :\
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Yumonra	[04:21:53] also would making periodic log compression & uploads to a centralized logging database save bandwith compared to sending logs realtime with a stream compression algorithm?

2016-09-05 21:58:39	f3ew	[05:10:06] Yumonra: log traffic should be a fairly small volume as compared to regular traffic. Compressing on the wire isn't very useful
2016-09-05 21:58:39	rycuda	[05:25:23] Honestly, use syslog.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	f3ew	[08:02:02] Unless you are one of those people who is supporting a 12 factor app
2016-09-05 21:58:39	rycuda	[09:06:47] then use syslog but use log shipping to make it go elsewhere.
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Groovin	[12:12:44] is this a good place to learn about DevOps?
2016-09-05 21:58:39	malinoff	[12:19:07] Groovin: not really

2016-09-05 21:58:39	Naypalm	[15:28:47] do you really care if it's invite only? closed communities are usually closed for a reason
2016-09-05 21:58:39	Naypalm	[15:28:57] and I don't wouldn't want to impose myself on them

2016-09-06 11:21:04	f3ew	[05:10:06] Yumonra: log traffic should be a fairly small volume as compared to regular traffic. Compressing on the wire isn't very useful
2016-09-06 11:21:04	rycuda	[05:25:23] Honestly, use syslog.

2016-09-06 11:21:04	pluszak	[06:38:40] Anyone have experience with gitlab CI? After reading: I think that the script from here: http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/examples/php.html should run 5.6 and 7.0 in parallel, however my gitlab runs them one at a time. Should I change something in gitlab config or am I missing something in the build script?

2016-09-06 13:56:54	Groovin	[13:02:07] Why is this group?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Groovin	[13:02:09] :)
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Groovin	[14:10:52] Uh... It's not.
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Groovin	[14:11:33] How do I join #devops instead of ##devops?
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Groovin	[14:11:40] Looks like it's 'invite only'.

2016-09-06 13:56:54	Naypalm	[15:28:18] it is invite only
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Naypalm	[15:28:47] do you really care if it's invite only? closed communities are usually closed for a reason
2016-09-06 13:56:54	Naypalm	[15:28:57] and I don't wouldn't want to impose myself on them

After reading: I think that the script from here: http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/examples/php.html should run 5.6 and 7.0 in parallel, however my gitlab runs them one at a time. Should I change something in gitlab config or am I missing something in the build script?

2016-09-06 14:03:23	Naypalm	[15:14:54] if they want their own MTA then fire up Exim somewhere, it's not *that* complex
2016-09-06 14:03:23	moritz	[15:17:55] well, sending emails can be a PITA, because of spam filters and such

2016-09-06 14:03:24	martman	[22:31:26] im trying to wrap my head around creating a nice setup using AWS. im currently using gitlab (with CI) and redmine. i see amazon offers some useful sounding stuff like codepipeline and im not sure how that can or should fit in
2016-09-06 14:03:24	martman	[22:31:58] is this a replacement for gitlabs functionality?
2016-09-06 14:03:24	martman	[22:32:18] i like gitlab, so i dont want to replace it any way really
2016-09-06 14:03:24	Errorrouss	[09:57:22] phpBB + nginx or phpBB  + apache? Any pros/cons of any option?

2016-09-06 14:03:24	Yumonra	[04:19:44] i always get lost when thinking about logging. is there any good resources/books about this topic?
2016-09-06 14:03:24	Yumonra	[04:19:53] there are subjects like security, performance, sufficiency, storage, analysis, notifications, semantics
2016-09-06 14:03:24	Yumonra	[04:20:13] i think logging is one of the hardest things to get right while programming :\
2016-09-06 14:03:24	Yumonra	[04:21:53] also would making periodic log compression & uploads to a centralized logging database save bandwith compared to sending logs realtime with a stream compression algorithm?

2016-09-06 14:03:24	f3ew	[05:10:06] Yumonra: log traffic should be a fairly small volume as compared to regular traffic. Compressing on the wire isn't very useful
2016-09-06 14:03:24	rycuda	[05:25:23] Honestly, use syslog.
2016-09-06 14:03:24	f3ew	[08:02:02] Unless you are one of those people who is supporting a 12 factor app
2016-09-06 14:03:24	rycuda	[09:06:47] then use syslog but use log shipping to make it go elsewhere.
2016-09-06 14:03:24	Groovin	[12:12:44] is this a good place to learn about DevOps?

2016-09-06 20:43:27	Yumonra	[04:19:53] there are subjects like security, performance, sufficiency, storage, analysis, notifications, semantics
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Yumonra	[04:20:13] i think logging is one of the hardest things to get right while programming :\
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Yumonra	[04:21:53] also would making periodic log compression & uploads to a centralized logging database save bandwith compared to sending logs realtime with a stream compression algorithm?

2016-09-06 20:43:27	f3ew	[05:10:06] Yumonra: log traffic should be a fairly small volume as compared to regular traffic. Compressing on the wire isn't very useful
2016-09-06 20:43:27	rycuda	[05:25:23] Honestly, use syslog.
2016-09-06 20:43:27	f3ew	[08:02:02] Unless you are one of those people who is supporting a 12 factor app
2016-09-06 20:43:27	rycuda	[09:06:47] then use syslog but use log shipping to make it go elsewhere.
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Groovin	[12:12:44] is this a good place to learn about DevOps?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	malinoff	[12:19:07] Groovin: not really

2016-09-06 20:43:27	Groovin	[14:11:33] How do I join #devops instead of ##devops?
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Groovin	[14:11:40] Looks like it's 'invite only'.

2016-09-06 20:43:27	Naypalm	[15:28:18] it is invite only
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Naypalm	[15:28:47] do you really care if it's invite only? closed communities are usually closed for a reason
2016-09-06 20:43:27	Naypalm	[15:28:57] and I don't wouldn't want to impose myself on them

2016-09-06 20:43:27	pluszak	[06:38:40] Anyone have experience with gitlab CI? After reading: I think that the script from here: http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/examples/php.html should run 5.6 and 7.0 in parallel, however my gitlab runs them one at a time. Should I change something in gitlab config or am I missing something in the build script?

2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:41:07] build new AMI's using packer, have them configured with your cfgmgt
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:41:16] then whenever shit breaks, just kill an instance and watch them come back :P
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:41:20] and use ELB
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:41:37] sounds simple enough, but yeah..
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:41:37] :D
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:41:50] anyway, I should be working a bit more than just chatting around, hehe
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:41:52] have a nice day!
2016-09-07 09:43:19	tantr1k	[04:45:53] cool and good one
2016-09-07 09:43:19	tantr1k	[04:45:56] BRB
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[04:51:12] How would I go about making the CI check standards only on recent commits? I need a hint for what keyword to search for
2016-09-07 09:43:19	malinoff	[04:57:27] pluszak: "only on recent commits"? How would it check not-so-recent commits?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[04:58:21] malinoff: well, like check the commits that differ from master? I'm working on a project that has a lot of historical code that doesn't meet the standards and will not be refactored
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:59:36] .isup news.ycombinator.com
2016-09-07 09:43:19	sys_stupid	[04:59:37] http://news.ycombinator.com looks fine to me.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:59:43] hmpf.. stupid office dns
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[04:59:51] *ahem* work.. yes.. :P
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[05:02:56] Sure I could run cs on everything and then grep the results for those that interest me but...it feels so homebrewed
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[05:03:47] can't you use a date range perhaps?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	malinoff	[05:05:08] pluszak: tell your CI to build only master branch?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[05:05:53] building only the master doesn't solve anything. There's still plenty of old code in master I don't want showing up
2016-09-07 09:43:19	malinoff	[05:12:18] pluszak: exclude it from your code checker
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[05:12:37] malinoff: what if someone adds a new function in old file?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	iamtew	[05:18:23] I'm getting the impression that codebase structure is more of an issue than filtering out the relevant commits, in this case..
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[05:28:10] malinoff: what if someone does decide to refactor an old class?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	malinoff	[05:28:25] pluszak: that's why you can't do what you want
2016-09-07 09:43:19	malinoff	[05:28:33] pluszak: you can't partially lint your code
2016-09-07 09:43:19	malinoff	[05:29:22] pluszak: if that "someone" refactors an old class in a way that a couple of lines change within an old method? Will you lint only these lines or the whole method?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[05:29:50] Yes mixing the standards is a problem
2016-09-07 09:43:19	malinoff	[05:30:34] pluszak: lint all your code - that's the answer
2016-09-07 09:43:19	tantr1k	[05:46:38] -whois
2016-09-07 09:43:19	f3ew	[07:14:44] pluszak: you lint any code/file which is touched
2016-09-07 09:43:19	f3ew	[07:15:00] So if someone makes a change, then that file needs linting
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[07:15:01] f3ew: but how?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	f3ew	[07:15:25] pluszak: list the files in the diff, and just run the linter on those?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[07:16:03] Interesting, though that will give a lot of false positives. Maybe I'll just set that to warning not fail
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[07:16:20] As a sidenote: phplint checks syntax, codesniffer checks the coding standard
2016-09-07 09:43:19	f3ew	[07:16:27] pluszak: let it fail. Whoever touched the file can lint it
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[07:17:12] f3ew: not really. Besides the codebase is 3rd party, we just make customizations for projects
2016-09-07 09:43:19	f3ew	[07:18:25] pluszak: then set the linter to use the coding standard for that project throughout?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[07:20:24] but the codebase doesn't meet the standard
2016-09-07 09:43:19	f3ew	[07:23:01] pluszak: either make the codebase the standard, or change the standard to whatever the codebase has
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[07:24:21] Okay, I'm using Moodle, we make changes to Moodle. However Moodle doesn't meet Moodle's coding standards because they introduced the standard when the project was mature and they decided not to refactor the old code (quite wise).
2016-09-07 09:43:19	pluszak	[07:25:33] So I only want to test the new changes against the standard. Moodle actually does that on their pull requests but the process is a bit complicated so I wanted to know how the whole problem is called
2016-09-07 09:43:19	moritz	[07:26:17] the problem is called "legacy software" :-)
2016-09-07 09:43:19	rycuda	[07:41:52] isn't it going to be easier in the short term, and better in the long term to run the whole project through the linter?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	rycuda	[07:42:06] Oh, no, all of Moodle. My bad.
2016-09-07 09:43:19	moritz	[08:38:47] I'm currently looking for a DB migration tool, and flywaydb looks good, but from the documentation it seems to support only SQL and Java migrations
2016-09-07 09:43:19	moritz	[08:39:03] and I'm looking for something that supports running arbitrary commands
2016-09-07 09:43:19	moritz	[08:39:32] can anybody recommend anything? Or a way to trick flywaydb into running shell commands?
2016-09-07 09:43:19	BradH	[08:46:36] what database are you using?

2016-09-07 17:22:11	bakwods_	[10:43:03] hello
2016-09-07 17:22:11	bakwods_	[10:43:29] what command can i use to view the directory a command/process was started from?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ccockerhamkc	[10:43:33] Good morning
2016-09-07 17:22:11	bakwods_	[10:44:07] on linux
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ccockerhamkc	[10:44:11] Man if somebody could tell me that, I'd love you.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	armin	[10:47:51] ccockerhamkc: you can't, without having control over a) the shell you start your process from (which you obviously start your process from, otherwise you wouldn't make assumptions about the directory being in) or b) the program that will be started, which in turn will see the $PWD environment variable.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	malinoff	[10:48:33] https://bpaste.net/show/47837ad81b07
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ccockerhamkc	[10:48:33] I didn't figure you could. Otherwise figuring out where guy before me ran these drush commands would be too easy :)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	sys_stupid	[10:48:34] [ show at bpaste ] - bpaste.net
2016-09-07 17:22:11	armin	[10:49:08] ccockerhamkc: so basically your best bet in the first place is to examine the environment your program runs in, especially the environment variables.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ccockerhamkc	[10:49:53] also bakwods_ this is for you too
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ccockerhamkc	[10:50:14] I was just curious because I've got a lot of undocumented stuff that only works if you run it in the right spot
2016-09-07 17:22:11	bakwods_	[10:50:33] aah, i see.. alright, thanks.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	malinoff	[10:50:47] bakwods_: https://bpaste.net/show/47837ad81b07

2016-09-07 17:22:11	iamtew	[10:51:23] got the pid? then just dig around in /proc/$PID and see what's there
2016-09-07 17:22:11	armin	[10:51:31] ccockerhamkc: you can also examine the proc filesystem if it's a linux machine, where each process will have files like "environ" or "cwd" for such purpose.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	iamtew	[10:51:52] lots of good stuff in the /proc filesystem
2016-09-07 17:22:11	armin	[10:54:08] ccockerhamkc: xargs --null --max-args=1 echo < /proc/1/environ | grep PWD
2016-09-07 17:22:11	armin	[10:54:21] ccockerhamkc: 1 is the PID number in your case.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	armin	[10:55:00] ccockerhamkc: so, actually, "you can't" wasn't essentially correct.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	armin	[10:55:11] ccockerhamkc: hope this helps.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ccockerhamkc	[10:55:38] bakwods_, does that help?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	bakwods_	[10:59:17] ccockerhamkc: yes, thank you very much!
2016-09-07 17:22:11	ccockerhamkc	[10:59:39] I did nothing but steal your answers :-)
2016-09-07 17:22:11	bakwods_	[11:13:17] armin: thank you
2016-09-07 17:22:11	armin	[11:18:43] bakwods_: welcome. if i can anyhow help you further please don't hesitate to ask.
2016-09-07 17:22:11	bakwods_	[11:26:54] we've been using fabric to automate deployment of our apps and their dependencies - we want to look into ansible for config management, would i still be able to use fabric with it?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	erzent	[11:28:14] who of Russia?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	opdev	[15:26:54] hi
2016-09-07 17:22:11	opdev	[15:27:07] so is consul + consul-template still a thing? I see more about docker-gen now...
2016-09-07 17:22:11	opdev	[15:27:14] maybe it is also a (flawed) personal perception though
2016-09-07 17:22:11	opdev	[15:27:33] And - how would you add letsencrypt to a reverse nginx proxy? Or rather haproxy? Or traefik? Or fabio?
2016-09-07 17:22:11	moritz	[15:33:35] opdev: iirc there's a letsencrypt client for nginx specifically
2016-09-07 17:22:11	opdev	[16:14:13] moritz: right - but would it make sense with nginx + consul as reverse proxy for docker containers ?

2016-09-07 21:02:38	f3ew	[07:18:25] pluszak: then set the linter to use the coding standard for that project throughout?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	pluszak	[07:20:24] but the codebase doesn't meet the standard
2016-09-07 21:02:38	f3ew	[07:23:01] pluszak: either make the codebase the standard, or change the standard to whatever the codebase has
2016-09-07 21:02:38	pluszak	[07:24:21] Okay, I'm using Moodle, we make changes to Moodle. However Moodle doesn't meet Moodle's coding standards because they introduced the standard when the project was mature and they decided not to refactor the old code (quite wise).
2016-09-07 21:02:38	pluszak	[07:25:33] So I only want to test the new changes against the standard. Moodle actually does that on their pull requests but the process is a bit complicated so I wanted to know how the whole problem is called
2016-09-07 21:02:38	moritz	[07:26:17] the problem is called "legacy software" :-)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	rycuda	[07:41:52] isn't it going to be easier in the short term, and better in the long term to run the whole project through the linter?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	rycuda	[07:42:06] Oh, no, all of Moodle. My bad.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	moritz	[08:38:47] I'm currently looking for a DB migration tool, and flywaydb looks good, but from the documentation it seems to support only SQL and Java migrations
2016-09-07 21:02:38	moritz	[08:39:03] and I'm looking for something that supports running arbitrary commands
2016-09-07 21:02:38	moritz	[08:39:32] can anybody recommend anything? Or a way to trick flywaydb into running shell commands?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	BradH	[08:46:36] what database are you using?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	bakwods_	[10:43:03] hello
2016-09-07 21:02:38	bakwods_	[10:43:29] what command can i use to view the directory a command/process was started from?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	ccockerhamkc	[10:43:33] Good morning
2016-09-07 21:02:38	bakwods_	[10:44:07] on linux
2016-09-07 21:02:38	ccockerhamkc	[10:44:11] Man if somebody could tell me that, I'd love you.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	armin	[10:47:51] ccockerhamkc: you can't, without having control over a) the shell you start your process from (which you obviously start your process from, otherwise you wouldn't make assumptions about the directory being in) or b) the program that will be started, which in turn will see the $PWD environment variable.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	malinoff	[10:48:33] https://bpaste.net/show/47837ad81b07
2016-09-07 21:02:38	ccockerhamkc	[10:48:33] I didn't figure you could. Otherwise figuring out where guy before me ran these drush commands would be too easy :)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	sys_stupid	[10:48:34] [ show at bpaste ] - bpaste.net
2016-09-07 21:02:38	armin	[10:49:08] ccockerhamkc: so basically your best bet in the first place is to examine the environment your program runs in, especially the environment variables.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	ccockerhamkc	[10:49:53] also bakwods_ this is for you too
2016-09-07 21:02:38	ccockerhamkc	[10:50:14] I was just curious because I've got a lot of undocumented stuff that only works if you run it in the right spot
2016-09-07 21:02:38	bakwods_	[10:50:33] aah, i see.. alright, thanks.

2016-09-07 21:02:38	iamtew	[10:51:23] got the pid? then just dig around in /proc/$PID and see what's there
2016-09-07 21:02:38	armin	[10:51:31] ccockerhamkc: you can also examine the proc filesystem if it's a linux machine, where each process will have files like "environ" or "cwd" for such purpose.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	iamtew	[10:51:52] lots of good stuff in the /proc filesystem
2016-09-07 21:02:38	armin	[10:54:08] ccockerhamkc: xargs --null --max-args=1 echo < /proc/1/environ | grep PWD
2016-09-07 21:02:38	armin	[10:54:21] ccockerhamkc: 1 is the PID number in your case.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	armin	[10:55:00] ccockerhamkc: so, actually, "you can't" wasn't essentially correct.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	armin	[10:55:11] ccockerhamkc: hope this helps.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	ccockerhamkc	[10:55:38] bakwods_, does that help?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	bakwods_	[10:59:17] ccockerhamkc: yes, thank you very much!
2016-09-07 21:02:38	ccockerhamkc	[10:59:39] I did nothing but steal your answers :-)
2016-09-07 21:02:38	bakwods_	[11:13:17] armin: thank you
2016-09-07 21:02:38	armin	[11:18:43] bakwods_: welcome. if i can anyhow help you further please don't hesitate to ask.
2016-09-07 21:02:38	bakwods_	[11:26:54] we've been using fabric to automate deployment of our apps and their dependencies - we want to look into ansible for config management, would i still be able to use fabric with it?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	erzent	[11:28:14] who of Russia?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	opdev	[15:26:54] hi
2016-09-07 21:02:38	opdev	[15:27:07] so is consul + consul-template still a thing? I see more about docker-gen now...
2016-09-07 21:02:38	opdev	[15:27:14] maybe it is also a (flawed) personal perception though
2016-09-07 21:02:38	opdev	[15:27:33] And - how would you add letsencrypt to a reverse nginx proxy? Or rather haproxy? Or traefik? Or fabio?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	moritz	[15:33:35] opdev: iirc there's a letsencrypt client for nginx specifically
2016-09-07 21:02:38	opdev	[16:14:13] moritz: right - but would it make sense with nginx + consul as reverse proxy for docker containers ?
2016-09-07 21:02:38	djboz	[19:56:40] When I head to my domain name it won't let me prepend www to my https:// URI. Where Netflix has https://www.netflix.com, where my site is still https://example.com rather than https://www.example.com  In my VirtualHost I have the ServerName as www.example.com & ServerAlias as example.com. I've added certificates to both www.example.com & example.com with the delimiter being -d. What could the issue be?(I'm using my actual do
2016-09-07 21:02:38	djboz	[19:56:40] main name, not example.com).

2016-09-08 10:38:49	iamtew	[10:51:52] lots of good stuff in the /proc filesystem
2016-09-08 10:38:49	armin	[10:54:08] ccockerhamkc: xargs --null --max-args=1 echo < /proc/1/environ | grep PWD
2016-09-08 10:38:49	armin	[10:54:21] ccockerhamkc: 1 is the PID number in your case.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	armin	[10:55:00] ccockerhamkc: so, actually, "you can't" wasn't essentially correct.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	armin	[10:55:11] ccockerhamkc: hope this helps.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ccockerhamkc	[10:55:38] bakwods_, does that help?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	bakwods_	[10:59:17] ccockerhamkc: yes, thank you very much!
2016-09-08 10:38:49	ccockerhamkc	[10:59:39] I did nothing but steal your answers :-)
2016-09-08 10:38:49	bakwods_	[11:13:17] armin: thank you
2016-09-08 10:38:49	armin	[11:18:43] bakwods_: welcome. if i can anyhow help you further please don't hesitate to ask.
2016-09-08 10:38:49	bakwods_	[11:26:54] we've been using fabric to automate deployment of our apps and their dependencies - we want to look into ansible for config management, would i still be able to use fabric with it?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	erzent	[11:28:14] who of Russia?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	opdev	[15:26:54] hi
2016-09-08 10:38:49	opdev	[15:27:07] so is consul + consul-template still a thing? I see more about docker-gen now...
2016-09-08 10:38:49	opdev	[15:27:14] maybe it is also a (flawed) personal perception though
2016-09-08 10:38:49	opdev	[15:27:33] And - how would you add letsencrypt to a reverse nginx proxy? Or rather haproxy? Or traefik? Or fabio?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	moritz	[15:33:35] opdev: iirc there's a letsencrypt client for nginx specifically
2016-09-08 10:38:49	opdev	[16:14:13] moritz: right - but would it make sense with nginx + consul as reverse proxy for docker containers ?
2016-09-08 10:38:49	djboz	[19:56:40] When I head to my domain name it won't let me prepend www to my https:// URI. Where Netflix has https://www.netflix.com, where my site is still https://example.com rather than https://www.example.com  In my VirtualHost I have the ServerName as www.example.com & ServerAlias as example.com. I've added certificates to both www.example.com & example.com with the delimiter being -d. What could the issue be?(I'm using my actual do
2016-09-08 10:38:49	djboz	[19:56:40] main name, not example.com).

2016-09-08 16:12:36	rycuda	[07:41:52] isn't it going to be easier in the short term, and better in the long term to run the whole project through the linter?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	rycuda	[07:42:06] Oh, no, all of Moodle. My bad.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	moritz	[08:38:47] I'm currently looking for a DB migration tool, and flywaydb looks good, but from the documentation it seems to support only SQL and Java migrations
2016-09-08 16:12:36	moritz	[08:39:03] and I'm looking for something that supports running arbitrary commands
2016-09-08 16:12:36	moritz	[08:39:32] can anybody recommend anything? Or a way to trick flywaydb into running shell commands?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	BradH	[08:46:36] what database are you using?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	bakwods_	[10:43:03] hello
2016-09-08 16:12:36	bakwods_	[10:43:29] what command can i use to view the directory a command/process was started from?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ccockerhamkc	[10:43:33] Good morning
2016-09-08 16:12:36	bakwods_	[10:44:07] on linux
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ccockerhamkc	[10:44:11] Man if somebody could tell me that, I'd love you.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	armin	[10:47:51] ccockerhamkc: you can't, without having control over a) the shell you start your process from (which you obviously start your process from, otherwise you wouldn't make assumptions about the directory being in) or b) the program that will be started, which in turn will see the $PWD environment variable.

2016-09-08 16:12:36	ccockerhamkc	[10:48:33] I didn't figure you could. Otherwise figuring out where guy before me ran these drush commands would be too easy :)

2016-09-08 16:12:36	armin	[10:49:08] ccockerhamkc: so basically your best bet in the first place is to examine the environment your program runs in, especially the environment variables.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ccockerhamkc	[10:49:53] also bakwods_ this is for you too
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ccockerhamkc	[10:50:14] I was just curious because I've got a lot of undocumented stuff that only works if you run it in the right spot

2016-09-08 16:12:36	armin	[10:54:21] ccockerhamkc: 1 is the PID number in your case.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	armin	[10:55:00] ccockerhamkc: so, actually, "you can't" wasn't essentially correct.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	armin	[10:55:11] ccockerhamkc: hope this helps.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ccockerhamkc	[10:55:38] bakwods_, does that help?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	bakwods_	[10:59:17] ccockerhamkc: yes, thank you very much!
2016-09-08 16:12:36	ccockerhamkc	[10:59:39] I did nothing but steal your answers :-)
2016-09-08 16:12:36	bakwods_	[11:13:17] armin: thank you
2016-09-08 16:12:36	armin	[11:18:43] bakwods_: welcome. if i can anyhow help you further please don't hesitate to ask.
2016-09-08 16:12:36	bakwods_	[11:26:54] we've been using fabric to automate deployment of our apps and their dependencies - we want to look into ansible for config management, would i still be able to use fabric with it?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	erzent	[11:28:14] who of Russia?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	opdev	[15:26:54] hi
2016-09-08 16:12:36	opdev	[15:27:07] so is consul + consul-template still a thing? I see more about docker-gen now...
2016-09-08 16:12:36	opdev	[15:27:14] maybe it is also a (flawed) personal perception though
2016-09-08 16:12:36	opdev	[15:27:33] And - how would you add letsencrypt to a reverse nginx proxy? Or rather haproxy? Or traefik? Or fabio?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	moritz	[15:33:35] opdev: iirc there's a letsencrypt client for nginx specifically
2016-09-08 16:12:36	opdev	[16:14:13] moritz: right - but would it make sense with nginx + consul as reverse proxy for docker containers ?
2016-09-08 16:12:36	djboz	[19:56:40] When I head to my domain name it won't let me prepend www to my https:// URI.

I've added certificates to both www.example.com & example.com with the delimiter being -d. What could the issue be?(I'm using my actual do

2016-09-09 16:48:29	zeroXten	[05:34:12] moritz: ok. Not sure group_vars means much to me :) But the general pattern looks reasonable
2016-09-09 16:48:29	zeroXten	[05:38:59] so if you had to choose, would you use "Production config", "production_config", "Config (Production)" or "prdcnf"?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	f3ew	[05:39:14] Just production
2016-09-09 16:48:29	f3ew	[05:39:59] config/<role>/{production,staging}
2016-09-09 16:48:29	f3ew	[05:40:07] (Or role/config)
2016-09-09 16:48:29	zeroXten	[05:41:20] hmmm, maybe using dirs was a bad idea.. files then ;)
2016-09-09 16:48:29	f3ew	[05:41:54] Same difference
2016-09-09 16:48:29	emilsp	[06:11:17] hmm, is there a way to test aws service outage ?
2016-09-09 16:48:29	emilsp	[06:11:28] like, I want to make sure I can't get to dynamo or s3 and see what my app will do
2016-09-09 16:48:29	malinoff	[06:31:09] emilsp: firewall it out
2016-09-09 16:48:29	emilsp	[06:38:32] hmm, fair enough
2016-09-09 16:48:29	danx11	[06:39:55] emilsp: bring in some chaos monkeys
2016-09-09 16:48:29	emilsp	[06:40:16] danx11: chaos monkeys will be deployed
2016-09-09 16:48:29	moritz	[06:41:23] are you talking about my kids? :-)
2016-09-09 16:48:29	iamtew	[07:08:46] that's why you should always keep your development environment in a kindergarten
